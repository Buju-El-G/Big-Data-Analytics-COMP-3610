      "1 Introduction The union of a set of n balls in R 3 has quadratic complexity Θ(n ), even if they all have the same radius. All the already known constructions have balls scattered around, however, and Sharir posed the problem whether a quadratic complexity could be achieved if all the balls (of same radius) contained the origin. In this note, we show a construction of n unit balls, all containing the origin, whose union has complexity Θ(n ). As a trivial observation, we observe that the centers are arbitrarily close to the origin in our construction. In fact, if the centers are forced to be at least pairwise ε apart, for some constant ε > 0, then no more than O( ε 3 ) can meet in a single point, and hence the union has complexity at most O( ε 3 n) = Oε(n). It is an interesting open question what a condition should be so that the union have subquadratic complexity and yet the balls have arbitrarily close centers. By contrast, the intersection of n balls can have quadratic complexity if their radii are not constrained, but the complexity is linear if all the radii are the same [2]. Similarly, the convex hull of n balls can have also quadratic complexity [1], but that complexity is linear if they all have the same radius. 2 Construction Let m and k be any integers. We define two families of unit balls: the first consists of k unit balls whose centers lie on a small vertical segment; the second consists of m unit balls whose centers lie on a small circle under the segment. (See Figure 3.) We show below that their union has quadratic O(km) complexity. The balls B1 . . . Bk. We denote by B(p, r) the ball centered at p and of radius r. Let n = k + m and Pi denote the point of coordinates (0, 0,(i − 1)/n4), and Bi = B(Pi, 1), for i = 1, . . . , k. It is clear that the boundary of ∪1≤i≤kBi consists of two hemispheres belonging to B1 and Bk linked by a narrow cylinder of height less than k/n4 ≤ 1/n3. This cylinder contains all the circles ∂Bi∩∂Bi+ for i = 1, . . . , k − 1. (See Figure 1.) ∗ INRIA, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis, France. {Herve.Bronnimann|Olivier.Devillers}@sophia.inria.fr 1Bk B ≤ n Figure 1: The union ∪1≤i≤kBi. The balls Bk+1 . . . Bk+m. Let R be the point of coordinates (x, 0, z) with x = 2n 2 − n , z = − 2n 2 − n . (Any values satisfying the constraints PkH < 1 in (1) and ℓ < n in (2) below would do.) We define θ as the rotation around the z-axis of angle 2π/m, and for each j = 1, . . . , m, Rk+j = θ j− (R) and Bk+j = B(Rk+j, 1). 3 Analysis By our choice of x and z, we prove below that the boundaries of Bk+1 and of the union ∪ k i=1Bi depicted in Figure 1 meet along a curve γ which satisfies the two claims below. The situation is depicted on Figure 2. Claim 1 The curve γ intersects all the balls Bifor i = 0, . . . , k, . Claim 2 The portion of γ which does not belong to B1 (equivalently, which belongs to the union ∪ k i=2Bi) is contained in an angular sector of angle at most 2π/m. From claim 2, we conclude that the portion of γ which does not belong to B1 is contained in the boundary of the union of the n = k + m balls, From claim 1, we conclude that the portion of γ which does not belong to B1 has complexity Ω(k). From claim 2, that it is contained in a small angular sector, hence appears completely on the boundary of the union of the n = k + m balls, and it is replicated m times, once for each of the balls Bj , j = 1, . . . , m. It follows that the union of all the balls Bifor i = 1, . . . , k + m has quadratic complexity Ω(km). Moreover, all the balls contain the origin. The union of the n balls is depicted on Figure 3. The proofs involve only elementary geometry and trigonometry. The situation is depicted in Figure 4 and 5. Figure 4 depicts a section in the xz-plane of the spheres ∂Bi and ∂Bk+1 and the point M, the highest point of intersection of the bounding spheres. The point M is also depicted on Figure 2. Proof of Claim 1. It suffices to prove that M is higher than Pk, since then γ extends higher than Pk as well and passes through M by symmetry. The lowest point of γ belongs to B1 and is clearly below the origin. The two facts together prove that γ must intersect all the balls between B1 and Bk. 2Bk B ≤ 2π n x z y Bk+ M γ Figure 2: The union S 1≤i≤k Bi ∪ Bk+1. The curve γ consists of a portion that belongs to B1 and of another portion which is contained in a dihedral sector of angle less than π/m. Let H be the point in the xz-plane on the median bisector of R and Pk, with same z-ordinate as Pk. (See Figure 4.) In order to prove that M is higher than Pk, it suffices to prove that H belongs to Bk, since then M is farther along the bisector. The two triangles QPkH and KRPk have equal angles, hence they are similar. It follows that PkH = PkR PkQ RK = PkR 2RK = x 2 + (z − zk) 2x , (1) where zk = k− n4 . For x and z as given in the construction, we have PkH = 1/ −40 n 4 − 15 n2 + 68 + 16 n6 − 16 n3 + 28 n n4(n2 − 2) which is smaller than 1 for n ≥ 2. Proof of Claim 2. It is easy to see that the intersection of γ and a ball Bi (2 ≤ i ≤ k) consists of at most two arcs of circle, any of which is monotone in angular coordinates around the z-axis, and that any such arc is entirely above the plane z = 0. Hence the intersections of γ with the xy-plane belong to B1 and Bk+1. It suffices to show that these intersections are at a distance ℓ at most n ≤ sin πm from the x-axis. (See Figure 5.) In the xy-plane section, B1 is a unit circle, and Bk+1 is a circle of radius r = √ 1 − z 2 and center R′ of coordinates (x, 0). (Recall that the center of Bk+1 has coordinates (x, 0, z).) Hence ℓ is the height of a triangle with base x and sides 1 and r < 1. It is elementary to compute that ℓ = s 1 − z 2 + x 2x . (2) 3Bk Bk+ B Bk+m Bk+2 Bk+ x y z Figure 3: The union ∪1≤i≤k+mBi.

      "1 Introduction Let G be an undirected simple graph with vertex set V (G) = {v1, . . . , vn} and edge set E(G), where e(G) is the number of edges of G. The adjacency matrix A(G) = (aij ) of G is the n × n matrix, where aij = 1 if viis adjacent to vj , and otherwise. The spectral radius of G is the largest eigenvalue of A(G), denoted by ρ(G), while the least eigenvalue of A(G) is denoted by λn(G). For v ∈ V (G), the neighborhood NG(v) of v is {u : uv ∈ E(G)} and the degree dG(v) of v is |NG(v)|. We write N(v) and d(v) for NG(v) and dG(v) respectively if there is no ambiguity. A path of order n is denoted by Pn. For V1, V2 ⊆ V (G), e(V1, V2) denotes the number of the edges of G with one end vertex in V1 and the other in V2. A graph G is said F-free if it does not contain F as a subgraph. A linear forest is a forest whose connected components are paths. For a path P3 of order 3, say xyz, we call y its center and x, z its two ends. For two vertex disjoint graphs G and H, we denote by G∪H and G∨H the union of G and H, and the join of G and H, i.e., joining every vertex of G to every vertex of H, respectively. Denote by k · G the k disjoint union of G. For graph notation and terminology undefined here, we refer the readers to [2]. ∗This work is supported by the Joint NSFC-ISF Research Program (jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Israel Science Foundation (No. 11561141001)) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.11531001) †Corresponding author. E-mail: xiaodong@sjtu.edu.cn 1The problem of maximizing the number of edges over all graphs without containing fixed subgraphs is one of the cornerstones of graph theory. In 2010, Nikiforov [17] proposed the following spectral extremal graph problem, which is the spectral analogue of Tur´an type extremal problem. Problem 1.1 Given a graph H, what is the maximum ρ(G) of a graph G of order n which does not contain H as a subgraph? On Problem 1.1, Nikiforov has obtained a bulk of work in this spectral analogue of Tur´an type extremal problem. For example, he presented some spectral analogues of classical results in extremal graph theory, such as spectral analogue of Tur´an type theorem [12] and the Erd˝os–Stone–Bollob´as theorem [14]. For more details, readers may be referred to [13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22]. In particular, Nikiforov [17] determined the maximum spectral radius of a graph that does not contain paths of given length as subgraphs and characterized all extremal graphs, which is a spectral analogue of Erd˝os-Gallai theorem (see [6]). A natural extension of this problem is to determine the maximum spectral radius of graphs without containing a linear forest. Lidick´y, Liu, and Palmer [9] determined the Tur´an number for a forbidden linear forest except for k ·P3 if the order of graph is sufficiently large and characterized all extremal graphs. Bushaw and Kettle [3], Campos and Lopes [4], and Yuan and Zhang [20], independently, determined the Tur´an number for a forbidden k · P3. In order to state these results, we need some symbols for given graphs. For 0 ≤ s ≤ ⌊n− ⌋, let Tn,s be the graph of order n obtained by identifying an end of each of s paths P3 and a vertex of each of n − 2s − 1 paths P2. Clearly, Tn, is a star of order n. For 0 < h < n, let Sn,h be the graph of order n obtained by joining every vertex of the complete graph Kh of order h to every vertex of the complement graph Kn−h of Kn−h, i.e., Sn,h = Kh ∨ Kn−h. Furthermore, let S + n,h be the graph obtained by adding an edge to Sn,h, i.e., S + n,h = K2 ∨ (Kh ∪ Kn−h−2). For 1 ≤ k < n, let Fn,k := Kk−1 ∨ (pK2 ∪ Ks), where n − (k − 1) = 2p + s and 0 ≤ s < 2. In particular, Fn,1 = pK2 ∪ Ks. Theorem 1.2 [9] Let F be a linear forest, i.e., F = ∪ k i=1Pai , with k ≥ 2, a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ak ≥ 2, and h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋ − 1. If there exists at least one ai not 3 and G is an F-free graph of order n, then for sufficiently large n, e(G) ≤ h + h(n − h) + c, where c = 1 if all ai are odd and c = 0 otherwise. Moreover, If c = 1 then equality holds if and only if G = S + n,h. Otherwise, the equality holds if and only if G = Sn,h. 2Theorem 1.3 [3, 4, 20] Let G be a k · P3-free graph of order n. Then e(G) ≤    n , for n < 3k; 3k − + ⌊ n−3k+ ⌋, for 3k ≤ n < 5k − 1; 3k − + k, for n = 5k − 1; k − + (n − k + 1)(k − 1) + ⌊ n−k+ ⌋, for n > 5k − 1. Moreover, (i) If n < 3k, then equality holds if and only if G = Kn; (ii) If 3k ≤ n < 5k − 1, then equality holds if and only if G = K3k−1 ∪ Fn−3k+1,1; (iii) If n = 5k−1, then equality holds if and only if G = K3k−1∪F2k,1 or G = F5k−1,k; (iv) If n > 5k − 1, then equality holds if and only if G = Fn,k. Motivated by Problem 1.1 and above results, we determine the maximum spectral radius of all graphs without a linear forest and characterize all extremal graphs. In addition, we also determine the maximum number of edges and spectral radius of bipartite graphs which do not contain k · P3 as a subgraph and characterize all extremal graphs. The main results of this paper are stated as follows. Theorem 1.4 Let F be a linear forest, i.e., F = ∪ k i=1Pai with k ≥ 2 and a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ak ≥ 2. Denote h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋ − 1 and suppose that G is an F-free graph of sufficiently large order n. (i) If there exists an even ai, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Sn,h) with equality if and only if G = Sn,h; (ii) If all ai are odd and there exists at least one ai > 3, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(S + n,h) with equality if and only if G = S + n,h. (iii) If all ai are 3, i.e., F = k · P3, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Fn,k) with equality if and only if G = Fn,k. Theorem 1.5 Let G be a k ·P3-free bipartite graph of order n ≥ 11k−4 with k ≥ 2. Then e(G) ≤ (k − 1)(n − k + 1). Moreover, if k = 2 then equality holds if and only if G = Tn,s, s = 0, 1, . . . , ⌊ n− ⌋; if k ≥ 3 then equality holds if and only if G = Kk−1,n−k+1. Theorem 1.6 Let G be a k ·P3-free bipartite graph of order n ≥ 11k−4 with k ≥ 2. Then ρ(G) ≤ p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if G = Kk−1,n−k+1. Corollary 1.7 Let G be a k · P3-free graph of order n ≥ 11k − 4 with k ≥ 2. Then λn(G) ≥ −p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if G = Kk−1,n−k+1. 3The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some known results and lemmas are presented. In Sections 3 and 4, we present the proof of Theorems 1.4, 1.5, and Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 3.3, respectively. In Section 5, some relations between the Tur´an theorem and spectral Tur´an theorem are discussed. 2 Preliminary In this section, we present some known results. Theorem 2.1 [8, 11] Let G be a graph of order n with the minimum degree δ = δ(G) and e = e(G). Then ρ(G) ≤ δ − 1 + p 8e − 4δn + (δ + 1) . It is easy to see that for 2e ≤ n(n − 1), the function f(x) = x − 1 + p 8e − 4xn + (x + 1) is decreasing with respect to x [11]. Theorem 2.2 [1] Let G be a bipartite graph. Then ρ(G) ≤ p e(G), with equality if and only if G is a disjoint union of a complete bipartite graph and isolated vertices. Lemma 2.3 [17] (i) For h ≥ 1 and n > h, ρ(Sn,h) = h−1+√ 4hn−(3h2+2h−1) . (ii) For h ≥ 2 and n ≥ h , ρ(S + n,h) < h−1+√ 4hn−(3h2+2h−3) . The following lemma is a little different from its original form[17, Lemma 14], but it can be seen from its original proof. Lemma 2.4 [17] Let c ≥ 0, h ≥ 2, n ≥ 4h , and let G be a graph of order n. If δ(G) < h and ρ(G) ≥ h − 1 + √ 4hn − 4h2 + c , then there exists a subgraph H of order p ≥ ⌊√ n⌋ satisfying one of the following conditions: (i) p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p; (ii) p > √ n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h−1+√ 4hp−4h2+c+ . Lemma 2.5 (i)If n − k + 1 is even, then ρ(Fn,k) = k−1+√ 4(k−1)n−(3k 2−2k−5) . (ii) If n − k + 1 is odd, then ρ is the largest root of x 3 − (k − 1)x2 − [(k − 1)n − (k2 − k − 1)]x + k − 1 = 0. (iii) k−1+√ 4(k−1)n−(3k 2−2k−1) 2 < ρ(Fn,k) ≤ k−1+√ 4(k−1)n−(3k 2−2k−5) . 4Proof. Denote ρ = ρ(Fn,k). Let x be a positive eigenvector of A(Fn,k) corresponding to ρ. Let n−(k−1) = 2p+s with 0 ≤ s < 2. By symmetry, all vertices of subgraphs Kk−1, pK2, or Ks in Fn,k = Kk−1∨(pK2∪Ks) have the same eigenvector components respectively, which are denoted by x1, x2, x3, respectively. (i) If n − k + 1 is even, then s = 0. By Ax = ρx, it is easy to see that ρx1 = (k − 2)x1 + (n − k + 1)x2, ρx2 = (k − 1)x1 + x2. It is easy to see that ρ = k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 5) . (ii) If n − k + 1 is odd, then s = 1. By Ax = ρx, it is easy to see that ρx1 = (k − 2)x1 + (n − k)x2 + x3, ρx2 = (k − 1)x1 + x2, ρx3 = (k − 1)x1. Hence we have ρ 3 − (k − 1)ρ2 − [(k − 1)n − (k2 − k − 1)]ρ + k − 1 = 0. Therefore ρ is the largest root of x 3−(k−1)x2−[(k−1)n−(k2−k−1)]x+k−1 = 0. In addition, ρ 2 − (k − 1)ρ − [(k − 1)n − (k2 − k − 1)] = − k − ρ < 0, which implies that ρ < k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 5) . Moreover, noting that ρ > ρ(Kk) = k − 1, we have ρ 2 − (k − 1)ρ − [(k − 1)n − (k2 − k)] = ρ − (k − 1) ρ > 0, which implies that ρ > k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 1) . 3 Proof of Theorem 1. In order to prove Theorem 1.4, we first prove the following three lemmas. Lemma 3.1 Let F be a linear forest, i.e., F = ∪ k i=1Pai with k ≥ 2 and a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ak ≥ 2. Denote h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋−1 and suppose that G is an F-free graph of sufficiently large order n. If there exists an even ai, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Sn,h) with equality if and only if G = Sn,h. 5Proof. Let G be an F-free graph of order n with the maximum spectral radius. Set δ = δ(G) and e = e(G). Since Sn,h is F-free, by Lemma 2.3 (i) we have ρ(G) ≥ ρ(Sn,h) = h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h2 + 2h − 1) . First we assume that h = 1. Then F = 2 · P2 or F = P2 ∪ P3. Obviously ρ(G) ≥ √ n − 1. By [17, Theorem 2], G contains a P4 unless G = Sn,1. Note that G is F-free. If F = 2 · P2, then G = Sn,1. If F = P2 ∪ P3, then G must be P4 ∪ Kn−4 or Sn,1. However, ρ(P4 ∪ Kn−4) < 2 ≤ √ n − 1. Thus G = Sn,1. So we now assume that h ≥ 2 and consider the following two cases. Case 1: δ ≥ h. By Theorem 2.1, ρ(G) ≤ δ − 1 + p 8e − 4δn + (δ + 1) ≤ h − 1 + p8e − 4hn + (h + 1) . Thus e ≥ hn − h 2+h 2 = e(Sn,h). Note that G is F-free. By Theorem 1.2, G = Sn,h. Case 2: δ < h. Note that ρ(G) ≥ h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h 2 + 2h − 1) = h − 1 + p4hn − 4h 2 + (h − 1) . By Lemma 2.4, there exists a graph H of order p such that either p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p; or p > √n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h2 + (h − 1) . If p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p, then 2e(H) = tr(A (H)) ≥ ρ (H) > (2h + 1)p > 2e(Sp,h). By Theorem 1.2, G contains F as a subgraph, which is a contradiction. So we now assume that p > √n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h 2 + (h − 1) . Applying Theorem 2.1 again, we have ρ(H) ≤ h − 1 + p 8e(H) − 4hp + (h + 1) . Hence e(H) > hp − h 2+h 2 = e(Sp,h). By Theorem 1.2, H contains F as a subgraph, which is a contradiction. So we finish the proof. 6Lemma 3.2 Let F be a linear forest, i.e., F = ∪ k i=1Pai with k ≥ 2 and a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ak ≥ 2. Denote h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋ − 1 and suppose that G is an F-free graph of sufficiently large order n. If all ai are odd and there exists at least one ai > 3, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(S + n,h) with equality if and only if G = S + n,h. Proof. Let G be an F-free graph of order n with maximum spectral radius. Set δ = δ(G) and e = e(G). Since S + n,h is F-free, by Lemma 2.3 (i) we have ρ(G) ≥ ρ(S + n,h) > ρ(Sn,h) = h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h2 + 2h − 1) . We consider the following two cases. Case 1: δ ≥ h. By Theorem 2.1, we have ρ(G) ≤ δ − 1 + p 8e − 4δn + (δ + 1) ≤ h − 1 + p8e − 4hn + (h + 1) . Hence e ≥ hn − h 2+h 2 + 1 = e(S + n,h). Note that G is F-free. By Theorem 1.2, G = S + n,h. Case 2: δ < h. Note that ρ(G) > h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h 2 + 2h − 1) = h − 1 + p4hn − 4h 2 + (h − 1) . By Lemma 2.4, there exists a graph H of order p such that either p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p; or p > √n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h2 + (h − 1)2 + . If p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p, then 2e(H) = tr(A (H)) ≥ ρ (H) > (2h + 1)p > 2e(S + p,h). By Theorem 1.2, G contains F as a subgraph, which is a contradiction. Now we assume that p > √ n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h2 + (h − 1)2 + = h − 1 + p4hp − (3h2 + 2h − 3) . By Lemma 2.3, ρ(H) > ρ(S + p,h). On the other hand, by Theorem 2.1 and δ(H) ≥ h, we have h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h 2 + (h − 1)2 + < ρ(H) ≤ δ(H) − 1 + p 8e(H) − 4δ(H)p + (δ(H) + 1) ≤ h − 1 + p 8e(H) − 4hp + (h + 1) . Therefore, e(H) > hp − h 2+h 2 + . So e(H) ≥ e(S + p,h). By Theorem 1.2 and H being F-free, we have H = S + p,h, which contradicts to ρ(H) > ρ(S + p,h). This completes the proof. 7Lemma 3.3 Let G be a k · P3-free graph of order n ≥ 8k 2 − 3k with k ≥ 2. Then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Fn,k) with equality if and only if G = Fn,k. Proof. Let G be a k ·P3-free graph of order n with maximum spectral radius. Since Fn,k is k · P3-free, we have ρ(G) ≥ ρ(Fn,k). We first prove the following claim. Claim: There exists a vertex u ∈ V (G) such that d(u) ≥ k and X v∈N(u) d(v) ≥ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1). Suppose that P v∈N(u) d(v) ≤ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k) for all u ∈ V (G). Let B = A2(G) − (k − 1)A(G) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k)]I and Bu be the row sum of B on u, where I is an identity matrix. Then ρ(B) = ρ (G) − (k − 1)ρ(G) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k)]. On the other hand, by [5, Lemma 2.1], ρ(B) ≤ max u∈V (G) Bu = max u∈V (G) X v∈N(u) d(v) − (k − 1)d(u) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k)] ≤ 0. Hence ρ(G) is no more than the largest root of x 2−(k−1)x−[(k−1)n−(k2−k)] = 0, i.e., ρ(G) ≤ k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 1) , which contradicts to ρ(G) > k−1+√4(k−1)n−(3k 2−2k−1) by Lemma 2.5 (iii). In addition, since 0 ≤ X v∈N(u) d(v) − (k − 1)d(u) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] ≤ d(u)(n − 1) − (k − 1)d(u) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] = d(u)(n − k) − (k − 1)(n − k) − < (d(u) − k + 1)(n − k), we have d(u) > k − 1, i.e., d(u) ≥ k. So the claim holds. Next we consider the following two cases. Case 1: k ≤ d(u) ≤ 3k − 2. Let W = V (G)\\({u} ∪ N(u)) and C ⊆ N(u) be the vertex subset such that every vertex in C has at least 2k neighbours in W. We claim that |C| = k − 1. Indeed, if |C| ≥ k then we can embed k · P3 with all centers in C and all ends in W into G, a contradiction. If |C| ≤ k − 2, then we have X v∈N(u) d(v) = X v∈C d(v) + X v∈N(u)\\C d(v) ≤ |C|(n − 1) + (d(u) − |C|)(2k − 1 + d(u)) = (n − d(u) − 2k)|C| + (2k + d(u) − 1)d(u) ≤ (n − d(u) − 2k)(k − 2) + (2k + d(u) − 1)d(u) ≤ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − [n − 3k(3k − 2) + k2 − 3k + 1] = (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − (n − 8k2 + 3k + 1) < (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1), 8which contradicts the claim. So |C| = k − 1. Since |C| = k−1, we can also embed (k−1)·P3 with all centers in C and all ends in W into G−u. Denote by S 1≤i≤k−1 Qi the (k−1)·P3 embedded into G−u, where Qi = xiyizi, yi ∈ C, xi, zi ∈ W for 1 ≤ i ≤ k−1. We claim that d(u) = k. Otherwise S 1≤i≤k−1 Qi together with a disjoint P3 with center u and two ends in N(u)\\C will yield k · P3, a contradiction. Then there exists exactly one vertex yk ∈ N(u) \\ C. Let W1 = {x1, . . . , xk−1, z1, . . . , zk−1}. We claim that yk has no neighbours in W. Otherwise, if yk has a neighbour, say z, in W\\W1 then S 1≤i≤k−1 Qi together with a disjoint P3 with center yk and two ends u, z yield k · P3, a contradiction. If yk has a neighbour in W1, without loss of generality, say x1, then S 2≤i≤k−1 Qi together with zy1z1 and uykx1 will yield k · P3, where z is a neighbour of y1 in W\\W1. It is a contradiction. This implies that N(yk) ⊆ N(u) ∪ {u} and d(yk) ≤ k. By Claim, 0 ≤ X v∈N(u) d(v) − (k − 1)d(u) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] = X k− i= d(yi) + d(yk) − (k − 1)k − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] ≤ (k − 1)(n − 1) + k − (k − 1)k − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] = 0, implying that d(y1) = · · · = d(yk) = (n−1), d(yk) = k, and N(yk) = {u, y1, . . . , yk}. Since G is k · P3-free, G − {u, y1, . . . , yk} is P3-free. So G − {u, y1, . . . , yk} consists of independent edges and isolated vertices, which implies that G ⊆ Fn,k. Then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Fn,k), which implies that ρ(G) = ρ(Fn,k). By the Perron Fronbenius theorem and the extremality of G, we have G = Fn,k. Case 2: d(u) ≥ 3k − 1. Then G[N(u)] must be (k − 1)P3-free. Otherwise, (k − 1) · P3 in G[N(u)] and a disjoint P3 with center u and two ends in N(u) will yield k·P3, a contradiction. Similarly, G−u is also (k−1)·P3-free. By Theorem 1.3, e(N(u)) ≤    3k − + j d(u)−3k+ k , for 3k − 1 ≤ d(u) ≤ 5k − 6; k − + (d(u) − k + 2)(k − 2) + j d(u)−k+ k , for d(u) > 5k − 6; and e(G − u) ≤ k − + (n − k + 1)(k − 2) + n − k + . If 3k − 1 ≤ d(u) ≤ 5k − 6, then X v∈N(u) d(v) ≤ d(u) + e(N(u)) + e(G − u) ≤ d(u) + 3k − + d(u) − 3k + + k − + (n − k + 1)(k − 2) + n − k + ≤ d(u) + d(u) + 9k 2 − 30k + + (2k − 3)(n − 1) − k 2 + 2k 9= (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − n + (2k − 5)d(u) − 10k 2 + 32k − ≤ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − n + (2k − 5)(3k − 1) − 10k 2 + 32k − = (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − n − 4k 2 + 15k − < (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1), which contradicts to the claim. If d(u) > 5k − 6, then X v∈N(u) d(v) ≤ d(u) + e(N(u)) + e(G − {u}) ≤ d(u) + k − + (d(u) − k + 2)(k − 2) + d(u) − k + + k − + (n − k + 1)(k − 2) + n − k + ≤ d(u) + (2k − 3)d(u) − k 2 + 2k + (2k − 3)(n − 1) − k 2 + 2k = (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − n − d(u) + 2k − ≤ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − k < (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1), which also contradicts to the claim. This completes the proof. Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.4. Proof. Theorem 1.4 directly follows from Lemmas 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. 4 Proofs of Theorems 1.5, 1.6, and Corollary 1. In this section, we will prove Theorems 1.5, 1.6, and Corollary 1.7. Proof of Theorem 1.5: Let G be a k ·P3-free bipartite graph of order n ≥ 11k − with the maximum number of edges. Since Kk−1,n−k+1 is k · P3-free, we have e(G) ≥ e(Kk−1,n−k+1) = (k − 1)(n − k + 1). We will prove the assertion by induction on k. If k = 2, then e(G) ≥ n − 1. Then G contains P3 as a subgraph. Otherwise G consists of independent edges and isolated vertices and so e(G) ≤ n 2 < n − 1, a contradiction. Clearly, every connected bipartite graph of order at least 3 contains P3 as a subgraph. Since G is 2 · P3-free, G has exactly one connected component H of order p ≥ 3 and any of the remaining components (if any exists) is either an edge or an isolated vertex. Then H is 2 · P3-free and e(H) ≥ e(G) − jn − p k ≥ n − 1 − n − p = n + p − . If 3 ≤ p ≤ 4, then e(H) ≥ 10. If p ≥ 5, then e(H) ≥ 11. Let Q = v1v2 · · · vl be the longest path of order l in H. Since P3 ⊆ H and H is 2·P3-free, we have 3 ≤ l ≤ 5. If l = 3, then H is a star Tp,0. On the other hand, e(G) ≥ n−1. Hence G = H = Tn,0. 10If l = 4, then V (H)\\V (Q) is an independent set and all vertices in V (H)\\V (Q) are adjacent to precisely one of v2 and v3. Hence H = Tp,1. On the other hand, e(G) ≥ n − 1. Then G = H = Tn,1. If l = 5, then H − V (Q) consists of independent edges and isolated vertices, say u1v1, . . . , uqvq, w1, . . . , wr, where q + r ≥ 1, in which each vertex has at most one neighbor, which is v3, in Q. Since H is a bipartite graph without containing 2 · P3, it is easy to see that H = Tp,s, where 2 ≤ s ≤ ⌊ p− ⌋. On the other hand, e(G) ≥ n − 1. Then G = H = Tn,s, 2 ≤ s ≤ ⌊n− ⌋. This completes the proof for k = 2. Suppose that the assertion holds for k − 1 ≥ 2. Since e(G) ≥ (k − 1)(n − k + 1) > (k − 2)(n − k + 2), By the induction hypothesis, we have (k −1)·P3 ⊆ G. We have the following claim. Claim 1: There exist k − 1 vertices in G with degree at least 3k − 1. In fact, take each P3 = xyz in (k−1)·P3. Then G−V (P3) must be (k−1)P3-free, since G is k·P3−free. By the induction hypothesis, e(G−V (P3)) ≤ (k−2)(n−k+2). Moreover, e(G[P3]) = 2 since G is bipartite. Hence e(V (P3), V (G)\\V (P3)) = e(G) − e(G − V (P3)) − e(G[P3]) ≥ (k − 1)(n − k + 1) − (k − 2)(n − k + 2) − = n − 2k + 1. Then there exists a vertex in P3 = xyz with degree at least n−2k+ 3 ≥ 3k − 1. Therefore, for (k −1)·P3, there exist k −1 vertices with degree at least 3k −1. This finishes the proof of Claim 1. Let U be a set of k−1 vertices in G with degree at least 3k−1. Then G−U is P free, i.e., G−U consists of independent edges and isolated vertices. Otherwise the P in G−U and other (k −1)·P3 with all centers in U and all ends in V (G−U)\\V (P3) will yield k · P3 in G since each vertex in U has degree at least 3k − 1. Further we have the following claim. Claim 2: U is an independent set. Suppose that U is not an independent set. Since G is bipartite, G[U] has a bipartition U = U1 ∪ U2 with e(U1, U2) ≥ 1. On the other hand, G − U has also a bipartition V (G − U) = W1 ∪ W2 with |W1| ≤ |W2|. Without loss of generality, G has a bipartition V (G) = (U1 ∪ W1) ∪ (U2 ∪ W2). Then e(G) = e(U1, U2) + e(W1, W2) + e(U1, W2) + e(U2, W1) ≤ |U1||U2| + |W1| + |U1||W2| + |U2||W1| < |W2||U2| + |U1||W1| + |U1||W2| + |U2||W1| = (|U1| + |U2|)(|W1| + |W2) = (k − 1)(n − k + 1), where the first inequality holds because G − U consists of independent edges and isolated vertices and |W1| ≤ |W2|, the second inequality holds because 1 ≤ |U1| ≤ k − 2 ≤ n−k+ 2 ≤ |W2|. This contradicts to e(G) ≥ (k − 1)(n − k + 1). Hence Claim 2 holds. In addition, we have the following Claim 3. Claim 3: V (G − U) is an independent set. 11Since G−U is P3-free, G−U consists of independent edges and isolated vertices. Suppose that there is an edge uv in G − U. Since G is a bipartite graph, u and v has no common neighbours in U. Then d(u) + d(v) ≤ k − 1. Then e(G) ≤ e({u, v}) + e({u, v}, V (G) − {u, v}) + e(G − {u, v}) ≤ 1 + k − 1 + (k − 1)(n − k + 1 − 2) < (k − 1)(n − k + 1). It is a contradiction. So Claim 3 holds. Then G is a bipartite graph with bipartite parts U and V (G) − U. Moreover, |U| = k − 1 and e(G) ≥ (k − 1)(n − k + 1). Therefore G = Kk−1,n−k+1. Proof of Theorem 1.6: Let G be a k · P3-free bipartite graph of order n with maximum spectral radius. Since Kk−1,n−k+1 is k · P3-free, we have ρ(G) ≥ ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1) = p (k − 1)(n − k + 1). By Theorems 2.2 and 1.5, ρ(G) ≤ p e(G) ≤ p (k − 1)(n − k + 1). Then ρ(G) = pe(G) = p(k − 1)(n − k + 1). By Theorem 1.5, G = Kk−1,n−k+1. Proof of Corollary 1.7: By a result of Favaron et al. [7], λn(G) ≥ λn(H) for some spanning bipartite subgraph H. Moreover, the equality holds if and only if G = H, which can be deduced by its original proof. By Theorem 1.6, ρ(H) ≤ p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if H = Kk−1,n−k+1. Since the spectrum of a bipartite graph is symmetry [10], λn(H) ≥ −p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if H = Kk−1,n−k+1. Thus we have λn(G) ≥ −p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if G = Kk−1,n−k+1. 5 Discussion It is known that if G is a Kr+1-free graph of order n, then e(G) ≤ e(Tn,r) and ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Tn,r) (for example, see [12, 18]), where Tn,r is a complete r-partite graph of order n with partite sets of cardinalities ⌊n/r⌋ or ⌈n/r⌉. Further spectral Tur´an theorem (ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Tn,r)) is a slight better than Tur´an theorem (e(G) ≤ e(Tn,r)). In fact, if ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Tn,r), then e(G) ≤ nρ(G) ≤ nρ(Tn,r) ≤ e(Tn,r). 12But in general, e(G) ≤ e(Tn,r) does not imply that ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Tn,r). On the other hand, from Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, we see that if G is an F-free graph of order n, where F is a linear forest, then the extremal graph maximizing the number of edges is the same as the extremal graph maximizing the spectral radius. Based on the above results, we may propose the following problem. Problem 5.1 For a given graph H, let G be an H-free graph of order n. If the extremal graph maximizing the number of edges is the same as the extremal graph maximizing the spectral radius, say G∗, then what is relations between e(G) ≤ e(G∗) and ρ(G) ≤ ρ(G∗)? Clearly, if G∗is Tn,r, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(G∗) implies that e(G) ≤ e(G∗). But if G∗is the extremal graph for a linear forest F, we give several examples to illustrate that they do not have \"implication\" relation, while if G∗is the bipartite extremal graph for k · P3, they have \"implication\" relation. Example 1: Let G = (Kr ∨ (K1 ∪ Kl−r)) ∪ Kn−l−1, where l + r = hn − h 2+h and 0 ≤ r < l. Then e(G) = hn − h 2 + h = e(Sn,h). Since hn − h 2 + h = l + r < l + < (l + 1) , we have l > p 2hn − h2 − h − 1. Thus ρ(G) ≥ ρ(Kl) = l − 1 > p 2hn − h2 − h − > h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h2 + 2h − 1) = ρ(Sn,h). Then e(G) ≤ e(Sn,h) and ρ(G) > ρ(Sn,h). Example 2: Let G be a 2h-regular graph of large order n. Obviously, ρ(G) = 2h < h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h2 + 2h − 1) = ρ(Sn,h) and e(G) = hn > e(Sn,h). Then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Sn,h) and e(G) > e(Sn,h). Example 3: Let G = (Kr∨(K1∪Kl−r))∪Kn−l−1, where l +r = j (2k−1)n−k 2+ k and 0 ≤ r < l. Then e(G) = (2k − 1)n − k 2 + = e(Fn,k). 13Since (2k − 1)n − k 2 + = l + r < l + < (l + 1) , we have l > p (2k − 1)n − k 2 − 1. Thus ρ(G) ≥ l−1 > p (2k − 1)n − k 2−2 > k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 5) ≥ ρ(Fn,k). Example 4: Let G be a 2k-regular graph of large order n. Obviously, ρ(G) = 2k < k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 1) < ρ(Fn,k) and e(G) = kn > (2k − 1)n − k 2 + = e(Fn,k). Proposition 5: Let G be a bipartite graph G of order n. If e(G) ≤ e(Kk−1,n−k+1), then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1). Indeed, by Theorems 2.2 and 1.5, ρ(G) ≤ p e(G) ≤ p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) = ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1). However, ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1) does not imply that e(G) ≤ e(Kk−1,n−k+1). For example, let G be a 2k-regular bipartite graph of large even order n. Obviously, ρ(G) = 2k < p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) < ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1) and e(G) = kn > (k − 1)(n − k + 1) = e(Fn,k). From above discussion, there is an interesting phenomenon for (spectral) Tur´an type problems. Spectral Tur´an type results imply the corresponding Tur´an type results for some given forbidden graphs, while Tur´an type results imply the corresponding spectral Tur´an type results for other given forbidden graphs,. This phenomenon may be worth to further investigate. References [1] A. Bhattacharya, S. Friedland, U. N. Peled, On the first eigenvalue of bipartite graphs, Electron. J.

      "1 Introduction Handball, a popular sport around the globe, is particularly important in Europe and South America. As there are many different aspects that can be analyzed, in the last years handball had also raised an increasing interests among researchers. For example, in Uhrmeister and Brosig (2018) a group of statisticians and sports scientists selected 59 items from the play-by-play reporting of all games of the 2017 IHF World Men's Handball Championship and the involved players were compared based on their individual game actions independently of game systems, concepts and tactical tricks. The data were clustered and collected in a matrix, to add up to a \"PlayerScore\". In another scientific work, the activity ∗Faculty of Statistics, TU Dortmund University, Vogelpothsweg 87, 44227 Dortmund, Germany, groll@statistik.tu-dortmund.de † jonas.heiner@tu-dortmund.de ‡Chair of Epidemiology, Department of Sport and Health Sciences, Technical University of Munich, g.schauberger@tum.de §Faculty of Sports Sciences, Ruhr-University Bochum, joern.uhrmeister@rub.de second halves of a match were compared (Chelly, Hermassi, Aouadi, Khalifa, Van den Tillaar, Chamari and Shephard, 2011). In this project we elaborate on a statistical model to evaluate the chances for all teams to become champion of the upcoming IHF Handball World Cup in Denmark and Germany. For this purpose, we launched a collaboration of professional statisticians and handball experts. While this task is rather popular for soccer (see, e.g., Groll, Schauberger and Tutz, 2015 or Zeileis, Leitner and Hornik, 2014), to the best of our knowledge this idea is new in handball. In the following, we will compare several (regularized) regression approaches modeling the number of goals the two competing handball teams score in a match regarding their predicitve performances. We start with the classical model for count data, namely the Poisson regression model. Next, we allow for under- or overdispersion, where the latter can be captured by the negative binomial model. Furthermore, as for large values of the Poisson mean λ the corresponding Poisson distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution (with µ = σ 2 = λ) due to the central limit theorem, this inspired us to also apply a Gaussian response model. Through this comparison, a best-performing model is chosen using the mathces of the IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017 as the training data. Based on its estimates, the IHF World Cup 2019 is simulated repeatedly and winning probabilities are calculated for all teams. The rest of the manuscript is structured as follows: in Section 2 we describe the underlying (training) data set covering (almost) all matches of the four preceding IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017. Next, in Section 3 we briefly explain four different regression approaches and compare them based on their predictive performance on the training data set. The best-performing model is then fitted to the data and used to simulate and forecast the IHF World Cup 2019 in Section 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 2 Data In this section, we briefly describe the underlying data set covering all matches of the four preceding IHF World Men's Handball Championships 2011 – together with several potential influence variables1. Basically, we use a similar set of covariates as Groll et al. (2015) do for their soccer FIFA World Cup analysis, with certain modifications that are necessary for handball. For each participating team, the covariates are observed either for the year of the respective World Cup (e.g., GDP per capita) or shortly before the start of the World Cup (e.g., a team's IHF ranking), and, therefore, vary from one World Cup to another. Some of the variables contain information about the recent performance and sportive success of national teams, as the current form of a national team should have an influence on the team's success in the upcoming tournament. Beside 1Principally, a larger data set containing more IHF World Cups together with the belowmentioned covariate information could have been constructed. However, for World Cups earlier than 2011 these data were much harder or impossible to find. For this reason we rerstrict the present analysis on the four IHF World Cup 2011 – 2017. 2these sportive variables, also certain economic factors as well as variables describing the structure of a team's squad are collected. We shall now describe in more detail these variables. Economic Factors: GDP per capita. To account for the general increase of the gross domestic product (GDP) during 2011 – 2017, a ratio of the GDP per capita of the respective country and the worldwide average GDP per capita is used (source: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/ 2018/01/weodata/index.aspx). Population. The population size is used in relation to the respective global population to account for the general world population growth during 2011 – 2017 (source: https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/ Standard/Population/). Sportive factors: ODDSET probability. We convert bookmaker odds provided by the German state betting agency ODDSET into winning probabilities. The variable hence reflects the probability for each team to win the respective World Cup. IHF ranking. The IHF ranking is a ranking table of national handball federations published by the IHF (source: http://ihf.info/en-us/ thegame/rankingtable). The full ranking includes results of men's, women's as well as junior and youth teams and even beach handball. The points a team receives are determined from the final rankings of World Cups of the respective sub-groups and Olympic games and strictly increase over the years, so the ranking system displays an all-time ranking of the national federations. All those results can be regarded totaled or separated for each team's section. Since this project only examines men's World Cups, merely the men's ranking table will be further disposed. IHF points. In addition to the IHF ranking, we also include the precise number of IHF points the ranking is based on. This provides an even more exact all-time ranking of the national federations' historic performances. Home advantage: Host. It can be assumed that the host of a Word Cup might have a home advantage, since the players' experience a stronger crowd support in the arena and are more conversant with the host country's cultural circumstances. Hence, a dummy is included indicating if a national team is a hosting country. Since the World Cup 2019 is jointly hosted by Germany and Denmark, both are treated equally. 3Continental federation. The IHF is the parent organization of the different continental federations, the African Handball Confederation (CAHB), the Asian Handball Federation (AHF), the European Handball Federation (EHF), the Oceania Continent Handball Federation (OCHF) and the Pan-American Team Handball Federation (PATHF). The nation's affiliation to the same continental federation as the host could on the one hand influence the team's performance similar to the Word Cup's host by their better habituation with the host's conventions. Additionally, supporters of those teams have a shorter arrival. On the other, hand handball is not equally prevalent on every continent, especially European club handball is most popular. To capture potential performance differences between the continental federations, two variables are added to the data set. A dummy determining whether a nation is located in Europe, and a dummy seizing whether a nation belongs to the same umbrella organization as the Word Cup host. Factors describing the team's structure: The following variables describe the structure of the teams. They were observed with the 16-player-squad nominated for the respective World Cup. (Second) maximum number of teammates. For each squad, both the maximum and second maximum number of teammates playing together in the same national club are counted. Average age. The average age of each squad is collected. However, very young players might be rather inexperienced at big tournaments and some older players might lack a bit concerning their condition. For this reason we assume an ideal athlete's age, here represented by the average age of all squads that participated in World Cups throughout the last eight years, so that the absolute divergence between a national team's average age and that ideal age is surveyed. Average height. The average height of a team can possibly impact the team's power. Tall players might have an advantage over short players, as they can release a shot on goal above a defender more easily. Therefore, we include the team's average height in meters. Number of EHF Champions League (EHF-cup) players. As club handball is mainly based on the European continent, the EHF Champions League is viewed as the most attractive competition, as numerous of the best club teams in the world participate and only the best manage to reach the final stages of the competition. Hence, also the best players play for these clubs. For this reason we include the number of players of each country that reached the EHF Champions League semifinals in the previous year of the respective World Cup. The same data is collected for the second biggest European club competition, the EHF-cup. 4Number of players abroad/Legionnaires. For each squad, the number of players playing in clubs abroad is counted. Factors describing the team's coach: The players of course extinguish the most important part of a squad, but every team additionally needs an eligible coach to instruct the players. Therefore, some observable trainer characteristics are gathered, namely Age and Tenure of the coach plus a dummy variable that determines whether he shares the same Nationality as his team. In total, this adds up to 18 variables which were collected separately for each World Cup and each participating team. As an illustration, Table 1 shows the results (1a) and (parts of) the covariates (1b) of the respective teams, exemplarily for the first four matches of the IHF World Cup 2011. We use this data excerpt to illustrate how the final data set is constructed. Table 1: Exemplary table showing the results of four matches and parts of the covariates of the involved teams.

For the modeling techniques that we shall introduce in the following sections, all of the metric covariates are incorporated in the form of differences. For example, the final variable Rank will be the difference between the IHF ranks of both teams. The categorical variables Host, Nationality as well as the two continental federation variables, however, are included as separate variables for both competing teams. For the variable Host, for example, this results in two columns of the corresponding design matrix denoted by Host and Host.Oppo, where Host is indicating whether the first-named team is a World Cup host and Host.Oppo whether its opponent is. As we use the number of goals of each team directly as the response variable, each match corresponds to two different observations, one per team. For the covariates, we consider differences which are computed from the perspective of the first-named team. For illustration, the resulting final data structure for the exemplary matches from Table 1 is displayed in Table 2. Due to some missing covariate values for a few games, altogether the final data set contains 334 out of 354 matches from the four handball World Cups 2011 – 2017. Note that in all the models described in the next section, we incorporate all of the above mentioned covariates. However, not all of them will be selected by the introduced penalization technique. Instead, rather sparse models will be prefered. 5Table 2: Exemplary table illustrating the data structure.

Actually, most of them (or slight modifications thereof) have already been used in former research on soccer data and, generally, all yielded satisfactory results. However, some adjustments are necessary for handball. All methods described in this section can be directly applied to data in the format of Table 2 from Section 2. Hence, each score is treated as a single observation and one obtains two observations per match. We aim to choose the approach that has the best performance regarding prediction and then use it to predict the IHF World Men's Handball Championship 2019. 3.1 Poisson model A traditional approach which is often applied, for example, to model soccer results is based on Poisson regression. In this case, the scores of the competing teams are treated as (conditionally) independent variables following a Poisson distribution (conditioned on certain covariates), as introduced in the seminal works of Maher, 1982 and Dixon and Coles, 1997. As already stated, each score from a match of two handball teams is treated as a single observation. Accordingly, similar to the regression approach investogated in Groll, Ley, Schauberger and Van Eetvelde (2018), for n teams the respective model has the form Yi jk|xik, x jk ∼ Po(λi jk), log(λi jk) = ηi jk := β0 + (xik −x jk) >β +z> ikγ +z > jkδ , (1) where Yi jk denotes the score of handball team i against team j in tournament k with i, j ∈ {1,...,n}, i 6= j and ηi jk is the corresponding linear predictor. The metric characteristics of both competing teams are captured in the p-dimensional vectors xik, x jk, while zik and zjk capture dummy variables for the categorical covariates Host, Nationality as well as the two continental federation variables (built, for example, by reference encoding), separately for the considered teams and their respective opponents. For these variables, it is not sensible to build differences between the respective values. Furthermore, β is a parameter vector 6which captures the linear effects of all metric covariate differences and γ and δ collect the effects of the dummy variables corresponding to the teams and their opponents, respectively. For notational convenience, we collect all covariate effects in the ˜p-dimensional real-valued vector θ > = (β > , γ >,δ > ). If, as in our case, several covariates of the competing teams are included into the model it is sensible to use regularization techniques when estimating the models to allow for variable selection and to avoid overfitting. In the following, we will introduce such a basic regularization approach, namely the conventional Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; Tibshirani, 1996). For estimation, instead of the regular likelihood l(β0,θ) the penalized likelihood lp(β0,θ) = l(β0,θ)−ξP(β0,θ) (2) is maximized, where P(β0,θ) = ∑ p˜ v= |θv| denotes the ordinary Lasso penalty with tuning parameter ξ . The optimal value for the tuning parameter ξ will be determined by 10-fold cross-validation (CV). The model will be fitted using the function cv.glmnet from the R-package glmnet (Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani, 2010). In contrast to the similar ridge penalty (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970), which penalizes squared parameters instead of absolute values, Lasso does not only shrink parameters towards zero, but is able to set them to exactly zero. Therefore, depending on the chosen value of the tuning parameter, Lasso also enforces variable selection. 3.2 Overdispersed Poisson model / negative binomial model The Poisson model introduced in the previous section is built on the rather strong assumption E Yi jk|xik, x jk= Var Yi jk|xik, x jk= λi jk, i.e. that the expectation of the distribution equates the variance. For the case of World Cup handball matches, the (marginal) average number of goals is around 30 (for example, y¯ = 27.33 for the matches of the IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017) and supposably the corresponding variance could differ substantially. A case often treated in the literature is the case when Var(Y) > E[Y], the so-called overdispersion. But for handball matches, also the contrary could be possible, namely that Var(Y) < E[Y] holds. In both cases, one typically assumes that Var(Y) = φ ·E[Y] holds, where φ is called dispersion parameter and can be estimated via φˆ = N −d f N ∑ i= r i , (3) where N is the number of observations and rithe model's Pearson residuals. We will first focus on the (more familiar) case of overdispersion. It is well known that the overdispersed Poisson model can be obtained by using the negative binomial model. To combine this model class with the Lasso penalty from equation (2), the cv.glmregNB function from the R-package mpath (Wang, 2018) can be used (see also, for example, Wang, Ma and Wang, 2015). 73.3 Underdispersed Poisson model If we fit the (regularized) Poisson model from Section 3.1 to our IHF World Cup data and then estimate the dispersion parameter via equation (3), we obtain a value for φˆ clearly smaller than one (φˆ = 0.74), i.e. substantial underdispersion. Hence, the variance of the goals in IHF World Cup matches seems to be smaller than their mean. To be able to simulate from an underdispersed Poisson distribution (which we would need later on to simulate matches from the IHF World Cup 2019), the rdoublepois function from the rmutil-package ((Swihart and Lindsey, 2018)) can be used. 3.4 The Gaussian response model It is well-known that for large values of the Poisson mean λ the corresponding Poisson distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution (with µ = σ 2 = λ) due to the central limit theorem. In practice, for values λ ≈ 30 (or larger) the approximation of the Poisson via the Gaussian distribution is already quite satisfactory. As we have already seen in Section 3.2 that the average number of goals in handball World Cup matches is close to 30, this inspired us to also apply a Gaussian response model. However, instead of forcing the mean to equate the variance, we again allow for µ 6= σ , i.e. for potential (constant) over- or underdispersion. Note here that the main difference to the over- and underdispersion models from the two preceding sections is that there each observation obtains its own variance via Var Yi jk|xik, x jk= φˆ · λi jk, where in the Gaussian response model all observations have the same variance σˆ . On our World Cup 2011 – 2017 data, we obtain σˆ 2 = 20.13, which compared to the average number of goals ¯y = 27.33 indicates a certain amount of (constant) underdispersion. We also want to point out here that in order to be able to simulate a precise match result from the model's distribution (and then, successively, to calculate probabilities for the three match results win, draw or loss), we round results to the next natural number. In general, the Lasso-regularized Gaussian response model will again be fitted using the function cv.glmnet from the R-package glmnet based on the linear predictor ηi jk defined in equation (1). 3.5 Increase model sparsity Note that in addition to the conventional Lasso solution minimizing the 10-fold CV error, a second, sparser solution could be used. Here, the optimal value for the tuning parameter ξ is chosen by a different strategy: instead of choosing the model with the minimal CV error the most restrictive model is chosen which is within one standard error of the minimum of the CV error. While it is directly provided by the cv.glmnet function from the glmnet package, for the cv.glmregNB function it had to be calculated manually. In the following section, where all the different models from above are compared, for each model class also this sparser solution is calculated and included in the comparison. 83.6 Comparing methods The four different approaches introduced in Sections 3.1 - 3.4 are now compared with regard to their predictive performance. For this purpose, we apply the following general procedure to the World Cup 2011 – 2017 data which had already been applied to soccer World Cup data in Groll et al. (2018): 1. Form a training data set containing three out of four World Cups. 2. Fit each of the methods to the training data. 3. Predict the left-out World Cup using each of the prediction methods. 4. Iterate steps 1-3 such that each World Cup is once the left-out one. 5. Compare predicted and real outcomes for all prediction methods. This procedure ensures that each match from the total data set is once part of the test data and we obtain out-of-sample predictions for all matches. In step 5, several different performance measures for the quality of the predictions are investigated. Let ˜yi ∈ {1,2,3} be the true ordinal match outcomes for all i = 1,...,N matches from the four considered World Cups. Additionally, let πˆ1i,πˆ2i,πˆ3i, i = 1,...,N, be the predicted probabilities for the match outcomes obtained by one of the different methods introduced in Sections 3.1 - 3.4. Further, let G1i and G2i denote the random variables representing the number of goals scored by two competing teams in match i. Then, the probabilities πˆ1i = P(G1i > G2i),πˆ2i = P(G1i = G2i) and πˆ3i = P(G1i < G2i) can be computed/simulated based on the respective underlying (conditionally) independent response distributions F1i,F2i with G1i ∼ F1i and G2i ∼ F2i. The two distributions F1i,F2i depend on the corresponding linear predictors ηi jk and ηjik from equation (1). Based on these predicted probabilities, following Groll et al. (2018) we use three different performance measures to compare the predictive power of the methods: • the multinomial likelihood, which for a single match outcome is defined as πˆ δ1 ˜yi 1i πˆ δ2 ˜yi 2i πˆ δ3 ˜yi 3i , with δry˜idenoting Kronecker's delta. It reflects the probability of a correct prediction. Hence, a large value reflects a good fit. • the classification rate, based on the indicator functionsI(y˜i = arg max r∈{1,2,3} (πˆri)), indicating whether match i was correctly classified. Again, a large value of the classification rate reflects a good fit. • the rank probability score (RPS) which, in contrast to both measures introduced above, explicitly accounts for the ordinal structure of the responses. For our purpose, it can be defined as 3− 3− ∑ r= r ∑ l= (πˆli −δly˜i) . As the RPS is an error measure, here a low value represents a good fit. 9Odds provided by bookmakers serve as a natural benchmark for these predictive performance measures. For this purpose, we collected the so-called \"three-way\" odds for (almost) all matches of the IHF World Cups 2011 – 20172. By taking the three quantities π˜ri = 1/oddsri,r ∈ {1,2,3}, of a match i and by normalizing with ci:= ∑ r= π˜ri in order to adjust for the bookmaker's margins, the odds can be directly transformed into probabilities using πˆri = π˜ri/ci . As we later want to predict both winning probabilities for all teams and the whole tournament course for the IHF World Cup 2019, we are also interested in the performance of the regarded methods with respect to the prediction of the exact number of goals. In order to identify the teams that qualify during both group stages, the precise final group standings need to be determined. To be able to do so, the precise results of the matches in the group stage play a crucial role4. For this reason, we also evaluate the different regression models' performances with regard to the quadratic error between the observed and predicted number of goals for each match and each team, as well as between the observed and predicted goal difference. Let now yi jk, for i, j = 1,...,n and k ∈ {2011,2013,2015,2017}, denote the observed numbers of goals scored by team i against team j in tournament k and ˆyi jk a corresponding predicted value, obtained by one of the models from Sections 3.1 - 3.4. Then we calculate the two quadratic errors (yi jk−yˆi jk) and (yi jk −y jik)−(yˆi jk −yˆjik) for all N matches of the four IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017. Finally, per method we calculate (mean) quadratic errors. Table 3 displays the results for these five performance measures for the models introduced in Sections 3.1 - 3.4 as well as for the bookmakers, averaged over 334 matches from the four IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017. While the bookmakers serve as a benchmark and yield the best results with respect to all ordinal critera, the second-best method's results are highlighted in bold text. It turns out that the Poisson and the underdispersed Poisson model yield very good results with respect to the classification rate, while the Gaussian response model is (in some cases clearly) the best performer regarding all other criteria. As no overdispersion (and, actually, underdispersion) is found in the data, the negative binomial model's results are almost indistinguishable from those of the (conventional) Poisson model. The more sparse Lasso estimators introduced in Section 3. perform substantially worse in terms of prediction accuracy compared to the conventional Lasso solution. Based on these results, we chose the regularized Gaussian response model with constant (and rather low) variance as our final model and shall use it in the next section to simulate the IHF World Cup 2019. 2Three-way odds consider only the match tendency with possible results victory team 1, draw or defeat team 1 and are usually fixed some days before the corresponding match takes place. The three-way odds were obtained from the website https://www.betexplorer.com/ handball/world/. 3The transformed probabilities implicitely assume that the bookmaker's margins are equally distributed on the three possible match tendencies. 4The final group standings are determined by (1) the number of points, (2) head-to-head points (3) head-to-head goal difference, (4) head-to-head number of goals scored, (5) goal difference and (6) total number of goals. If no distinct decision can be taken, the decision is taken by lot. 10Table 3: Comparison of the different methods for ordinal match outcomes; the second-best method's results are highlighted in bold text.

Odds 0.6688 0.8114 0.1256 - - 4 Prediction of the IHF World Cup Now we apply the best-performing model from Section 3, namely the regularized Gaussian response model with constant underdispersion, to the full World Cup 2011 – 2017 training data and will then use it to calculate winning probabilities for the World Cup 2019. For this purpose, the covariate information from Section 2 has to be collected for all teams participating at the 2019 World Cup. It has to be stated that at the time this analysis has been performed, namely at the first tournament day (June 10, 2019) right before the start of the tournament, the teams of Bahrein and Sweden had listed squads consisting of 15 players only and there will probably be one more player moving up soon. Hence, for those two teams the covariates corresponding to natural-numbered team structure variables (such as, e.g., the number of legionnaires) have been normalized to be comparable to 16-player squads by multiplying them with the factor 16/15. Another special case concerns the team of Korea. As this team is fromed by a selection of players from both South and North Korea, the federation was given the special approval to nominate 20 players. As it actually might be an advantage to have a larger squad we abstained here from normalizing the covariate values from the Korean team. The optimal tuning parameter ξ of the L1-penalized Gaussian response model, which minimizes the deviance shown in Figure 1 (left), leads to a model with (out of possibly 22) regression coefficients different from zero. The paths illustrated in Figure 1 (right) show that three covariates enter the model rather early. These are the Rank, the Height and the Odds, which seem to be rather important when determining the score in a handball World Cup match. The corresponding fixed effects estimates for the (scaled) covariates are shown in Table 4. 110.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1. 22 24 26 28 30 log(ξ + 1) Deviance log(ξopt + 1) = 0. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1. −2.0 −1.0 0.0 1. log(ξ + 1) βj ^ log(ξopt + 1) = 0.

Next, we can simulate all resulting matches in the main round and determine those teams that reach the semi-finals and, finally, those two teams that reach the final and the World Champion. We repeat the simulation of the whole tournament 100,000 times. This way, for each of the 24 participating teams probabilities to reach the different tournament stages and, finally, to win the tournament are obtained. 124.1 Probabilities for IHF World Cup 2019 Winner For each match in the World Cup 2019, the model can be used to predict an expected number of goals for both teams. Given the expected number of goals, a real result is drawn by assuming two (conditionally) independent Gaussian distributions for both scores, which are then rounded to the closest natural number. Based on these results, all 60 matches from the preliminary round can be simulated and final group standings can be calculated. Due to the fact that real results are simulated, we can precisely follow the official IHF rules when determining the final group standings (see footnote 4). This enables us to determine the matches in the main round and we can continue by simulating those matches. Again, if the final group standings are calculated, the semi-final is determined. Next, the semi-final can be simulated and the final is determined. In the case of draws in \"knockout\" matches, we simulate extra-time by a second simulated result. However, here we multiply the expected number of goals by the factor 1/ to account for the shorter time to score (10 min instead of 60 min). In the case of a further draw in the first extra-time, we repeat this procedure. If the second extra time still ends in a draw we simulate the penalty shootout by a (virtual) coin flip. Following this strategy, a whole tournament run can be simulated, which we repeat 100,000 times. Based on these simulations, for each of the 24 participating teams probabilities to reach (at least) the main round or the given final rank and, finally, to win the tournament are obtained. These are summarized in Table 5 together with the winning probabilities based on the ODDSET odds for comparison. Apparently, the resulting winning probabilities show some discrepancies from the probabilities based on the bookmaker's odds. Though the upper and lower half of the teams according to our calculated probabilities seem to coincide quite well with the overall ranking according to the bookmaker's odds, for single teams from the upper half, in particular, Denmark, Spain and Hungary, the differences between our approach and the bookmaker are substantial. Based on our model, Denmark is the clear favorite for becoming IHF World Champion 2019. These discrepancies could be mostly explained by the fact that the Lasso coefficient estimates from Table 4 include several other covariate effects beside the bookmaker's odds. 4.2 Group rankings Finally, based on the 100,000 simulations, we also provide for each team the probability to reach the main round. The results together with the corresponding probabilities are presented in Table 6. Obviously, there are large differences with respect to the groups' balances. While the model forecasts for example Spain and Croatia in Group B, Denmark and Norway in Group C and Hungary and Sweden in Group D with probabilities clearly larger than 90% to reach the second group stage, in Group A France followed by Germany are the main favorites, but with lower probabilities of 89.05% and 80.16%, respectively. Hence, Group A seems to be more volatile. 13Table 5: Estimated probabilities (in %) for reaching (at least) the main round or the given final ranks in the IHF World Cup 2019 for all 24 teams based on 100,000 simulation runs of the IHF World Cup together with winning probabilities based on the ODDSET odds.

We chose the Gaussian response model with constant and rather low variance (indicating a tendency of underdispersion) as our final model as the most promising candidate and fitted it to a training data set containing all matches of the four previous IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017. Based on the corresponding estimates, we repeatedly simulated the IHF World Cup 2019 100,000 times. According to these simulations, the teams from Denmark (37.2%) and France (19.4%) turned out to be the top favorites for winning the title, with a clear advantage for Denmark. 14Table 6: Probabilities for all teams to reach the main round at the IHF World Cup 2019 based on 100,000 simulation runs.

      "1 Introduction The famous six Painlev´e equations play a significant role in modern mathematical physics. The interest in their non-commutative extensions was motivated by the needs of modern quantum physics as well as by natural attempts of mathematicians to extend \"classical\" structures to the non-commutative case. In the paper [14], the Painlev´e equations were written as polynomial systems of the form    f(z) du dz = P1(u, v) + z Q1(u, v), f(z) dv dz = P2(u, v) + z Q2(u, v), (1) where f(z) = z(z − 1) for the P6 system, f(z) = z in the P5 and P3 cases and f(z) = for remaining types of Painlev´e systems. The right-hand sides of systems depend on several arbitrary parameters κi. We consider systems of the form (1), where Pi , Qi are polynomials with constant scalar coefficients in non-commutative variables u and v. For simplicity, we regard these variables as matrices of an arbitrary size m . We assume that if m = 1 then the system (1) coincides with one of the six Painlev´e systems P1 − P6. Some examples of integrable non-abelian systems of the form (1) are contained in [12, 4, 3, 7, 15, 1, 2]. Some of them were found using the existence of special isomonodromy representations or the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test while several of the systems have been derived from integrable PDEs and lattices by reductions. Classification papers [4, 3, 7] devoted to systems of P1, P2, and P4 were based on the matrix Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test. Unfortunately, for the P3, P5, and P6 systems this approach turns out to be too laborious. Мoreover, in this approach it is essential that the variables u and v are matrices. In [6] a different integrability criterion based on the existence of a non-abelian Okamoto integral was used. As a result, a collection of new non-abelian systems of P3, P5, and P6 type was obtained. However, some of known non-abelian systems do not have the Okamoto integral. ∗National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation. †L.D. Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Chernogolovka, Russian Federation. 1Using the non-abelian formalism (see, for example, [13]), all considerations can be trivially generalized to the non-abelian case. For this reason, in this paper we do not distinguish \"matrix\" and \"non-abelian\" systems. 1In this paper we propose an approach related to properties of the autonomous system    du dt = P1(u, v) + z Q1(u, v), dv dt = P2(u, v) + z Q2(u, v), (2) obtained from system (1) by freezing the independent variable. In system (2) we treat z as a parameter. We call system (2) the auxiliary autonomous system for (1). Our classification of integrable non-abelian Painlev´e systems (1) is based on the following Assumption 1. The corresponding auxiliary system is supposed to be integrable. This means that: 1. System (2) has a Lax representation Lt = [M, L] (3) with a spectral parameter. 2. It has infinitely many polynomial non-abelian infinitesimal symmetries commuting with each other. Each of these symmetries has a Lax representation of the form (3) with the same operator L (but with different operator M). 3. All systems of this hierarchy have the same set of first integrals defined by trace (L i ). 4. The Lax operators, first integrals, and symmetries coincide with the corresponding components of the scalar hierarchy when the size m of matrices is equal to one. It turns out that known examples of non-abelian Painlev´e systems satisfy some of these conditions (for P1 and P2 see [8]). The hierarchy of Assumption 1 can be obtained from the trivial hierarchy of the scalar auxiliary system by the non-abelianization procedure [16, 7] described in Section 2. Using the simplest example of Painlev´e-2 systems, we show in Subsection 2.1 how the ingredients of a non-abelian hierarchy can be constructed. It turns out that non-abelianization of only two simplest first integrals and one infinitesimal symmetry allows one to obtain a finite list of non-abelian P2 systems. These systems coincide with ones from the paper [3], where a different criterion of integrability for matrix Painlev´e-2 equations has been used. In Section 3, using the same approach, we find a complete list of Painlev´e-6 type autonomous systems. Due to the complexity of the calculations, we first classify homogeneous systems, which are the leading parts of autonomous systems of the P6 type. For each leading part, finding the remaining coefficients is not too difficult. The resulting list contains different systems, including 19 systems from [5, 6]. One of the reasons for the appearance of a large number of non-abelian systems of the same type is the presence of transformations that preserve integrability of systems (2) or (1). The simplest example of such a transformation is the matrix transposition τ(u) = u T , τ(v) = v T . In Appendix A.1, we present an explicit form of only 8 new systems non-equivalent with respect to τ. For the old 19 systems we use the notation and lists from our previous papers [5, 6]. To reconstruct the Painlev´e system of the form (1) corresponding to an autonomous P6 system (2) described in Section 3, we have to replace the time t with z and choose f(z) = z(z − 1) in (1). 2A group of point transformations (see Subsection 5.1.1) isomorphic to S3 × Z2 acts on the set of all non-autonomous systems of the Painlev´e-6 type. The Hamiltonian systems [5] form one orbit of this action, while the systems with the generalized Okamoto integral [6] and systems listed in Appendix A.1 have three and four orbits, respectively. Thus, there are 8 non-equivalent systems of the Painlev´e-6 type. Following Assumption 1, in Section 4, we find all autonomous non-abelian Painlev´e systems of P1 − P5 types. All known and several new systems are contained in our list. New systems are presented in Appendices A.5 – A.2. Non-autonomous Painlev´e P1 − P5 systems are restored using autonomous systems found in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to the study of non-autonomous Painlev´e systems whose auxiliary autonomous systems were constructed in Sections 3 and 4. In subsection 5.1, we describe admissible transformations in each of the cases P1 − P6. For non-abelian systems of P6 type we present in subsection 5.2.1 an universal formula for isomonodromic Lax pairs of the form Az − Bλ = [B, A], (4) where A(z, u, v, λ) and B(z, u, v, λ) are some 2×2 matrices, rational in the spectral parameter λ and in z, linear in the parameters κi, and polynomial in u, v. It is suitable for a wide family of systems whose autonomous systems satisfy the condition 3 of Assumption 1. Besides κi , the family contains 9 parameters. To specify these parameters we apply the non-abelianization procedure for symmetries of the autonomous system. Similar universal formulas for the Lax representation were also found in Subsections 5.2.2 – 5.2.6 for P5 − P1 type systems. It turns out that non-abelian systems of the Painlev´e-6 type generate non-abelian Painlev´e systems of the P1 − P5 type by the standard limiting procedure described in [6]. In Subsection 5.3 we present limiting transition schemes for new P6 systems obtained in this paper. 2 Non-abelianization of hierarchy In the scalar Painlev´e case, any auxiliary system (2) has a polynomial Hamiltonian H and a Lax representation (3). The hierarchy of commuting symmetries consists of the systems ( utk = (P1 + z Q1) Hk, vtk = (P2 + z Q2) Hk, (5) which have the Lax representations Ltk = [HkM, L]. (6) These symmetries are trivial: if we fix a value of the integral H then the symmetries coincide (up to a scaling of t) with the system (2). We assume that all the above components of the hierarchy admit the non-abelianization. This means that • we consider systems of the form (2) with matrix polynomials Pi and Qi such that if the size m of matrices u and v is equal to one, the systems coincide with the corresponding auxiliary autonomous system for a given scalar system of Painlev´e type; • there exist matrix polynomials Si such that if m = 1 they coincide with Hi and traces of Si are first integrals of the matrix system2; 2We do not assume that trace S1 is its Hamiltonian. 3• the matrix system has a Lax representation (3) that coincides with the representation for scalar system if m = 1; • for any k the matrix system has a (matrix) symmetry that coincides with (5) if m = 1. These symmetries commute with each other; • any matrix symmetry possesses a Lax representation coinciding with the scalar representation (6) if m = 1. 2.1 Painlev´e-2 systems Let us illustrate our approach by the simplest example of the Painlev´e-2 systems. Starting with trivial hierarchy of the scalar system, we show that the non-abelianization of several its ingredients leads to a finite list of matrix Painlev´e-2 systems. It was proved in [3] that all these systems satisfy the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test. In the commutative case, the system has the form    du dz = −u 2 + v − z, dv dz = 2uv + κ, (7) where κ is an arbitrary parameter. This system is Hamiltonian with the Hamiltonian H = −u v + v 2 − κu − zv, which is a first integral for the auxiliary autonomous system    du dt = −u 2 + v − z, dv dt = 2uv + κ. (8) It is clear that the systems    du dtk = (−u 2 + v − z) Hk, dv dtk = (2uv + κ) Hk (9) are commuting infinitesimal symmetries for (8). It is easy to verify that Lax representation (3) with L(λ) = −4 0 λ 2 + 0 4u 4u λ + 2u 2 + z −2u2 + 2v − z 2u 2 − 2v + z −2u2 − z + 0 κ κ λ − , M(λ) = 1 0 − λ + −βu −u −u −βu (10) is a Lax representation for system (8) 3 and therefore the operators L and Mk = Hk M define a Lax pair for system (9). The hierarchy described above looks completely trivial: all integrals are powers of only one integral H, the symmetries and corresponding M-operators are proportional if we fix a value of H. However, all these objects become non-trivial after the non-abelianization [16, 7]. In the scalar case the parameter β in the M-operator is inessential. 4For the non-abelianization of system (8), we replace each monomial in the right-hand side by a sum of non-commutative monomials such that under the commutative reduction the system coincides with (8). The result can be written in the form    du dt = −u 2 + v − z, dv dt = uv + vu + β[v, u] + κ, (11) where κ, β ∈ C. 2.1.1 Non-abelianization of integrals Let us generalize to the non-abelian case several first integrals. Proposition 1. For any β the autonomous system (11) possesses first integrals of the form traceS1 and trace S2 such that under the commutative reduction the non-commutative polynomials S1 and S2 coincide with H and H , respectively. Proof. The general ansatz for the polynomial S1 can be written as S1 = −u v + v 2 − κu − zv. One can verify that the condition d dt trace (Si) = 0 (12) with i = 1 holds. Using the explicit formula H2 = u v 2 − u v 3 + v 4 + 2κu v − κuv2 + κ 2u2 + z u v 2 − v 3 + κuv + z v , we construct a general ansatz for the non-abelian polynomial S2. Since the monomials {vu3vu, vu2vu2, vu4v}, {vuvuv, vu2v }, {vuvu, vu2v}, {vuv} define complete lists of homogeneous polynomials of degrees (4, 2), (2, 3), (2, 2) and (1, 2) in u and v up to commutators, we take S2 = a1vu3vu + a2vu2vu2 + (1 − a1 − a2)vu4v + a3vuvuv + (−1 − a3)vu2v 2 + v + 2κvu3 − κvuv + κu2 + z a4vuvu + (1 − a4)vu2v − v 3 + κvu + z v . Condition (12) with i = 2 leads to a system of linear algebraic equations for aj , j = 1, . . . , 4, whose coefficients depend on β. Solving this system, we find that for any β a1 = 0, a2 = 1, a3 = and a4 remains to be arbitrary. Therefore, the autonomous system has the first integral traceS2, where S2 = vu2vu2 − vu2v 2 + v 4 + 2κvu3 − κvuv + κu2 + z vu2v − v 3 + κvu + a4z(vu2v − vuvu) + z v . In the case of the non-commutative Painlev´e-2 system, the general ansatz for the righthand side depends only on one parameter β and our first test, based on the non-abelianization of the first integrals, does not determine β. For comparison, in the case of the Painlev´e-6, it reduces the number of unknown coefficients from 18 to 9. 4Note that such polynomials are defined up to commutators. 52.1.2 Non-abelianization of symmetries In contrast to the above computation, the non-abelianization of the simplest symmetry (9) with k = 1 gives rise to a condition for β. The general ansatz for the non-abelian symmetry has the form ut1 = a1u v + a2u vu + a3u vu2 + a4uvu3 + 1 − Xai vu4 + c1u v 2 + c2uvuv + c3uv2u + c4vu2v + c5vuvu + − 2 − Xci v 2u2 + κu3 + v 3 + e1uv + (−κ − e1)vu + z g1u v + g2uvu + (1 − g1 − g2)vu2 − v 2 + κu+ z v, vt1 = b1 u v 2 + b2 u vuv + b3 u v 2u + b4 uvu v + b5 uvuvu + b6 uv2u 2 + b7 vu v + b8 vu2vu + b9vuvu2 + −2 − Xbi v 2u3 + d1uv3 + d2vuv2 + d3v2uv + 1 − Xdi v 3u + f1u v + f2uvu + (−3κ − f1 − f2)vu2 + κv2 − κ 2u + z h1uv2 + h2vuv + (−1 − h1 − h2)v 2u − κv, where ai, bi, ci, di, e1, fi, gi, hi ∈ C. According to the item 3 of Assumption 1, the symmetry should have the first integrals trace S1 and trace S2 found in Proposition 1. That leads to the following linear relations between coefficients of the symmetry b1 = −a1, b2 = −a1 − a2, b3 = 0, b4 = −a1 − a2 − a3, b5 = 0, b6 = 0, b7 = 1 − a2 − a3 − a4, b8 = −1 + a1 + a2, b9 = −1 + a1 + a2 + a3, c4 = − , c5 = −c2, d1 = −c1, d2 = 2 + c1 − c2, d3 = −12 − c1 + c2 − c3, f2 = −κ, h1 = −g1, h2 = −g2. The remaining coefficients of the symmetry can be easily expressed via β from the compatibility conditions ut τ − uτ t = 0 and vt τ − vτ t = 0 as follows a1 = 24 (β − 2) (β 2 − 1)β, a2 = − (β 2 − 4) (β − 1) β, a3 = (β 2 − 4) (β2 − 1), a4 = − (β 2 − 4) β (β + 1), c1 = − 12 (β − 2) (β − 1) (β + 3), c2 = (β 2 − 4) β, c3 = 0, e1 = − κ, f1 = κ (β − 1), g2 = (2 − β − 4g1). Substituting these formulas into the compatibility conditions, we arrive at β (β 2 − 1) (β2 − 4) = 0, β (β − 2) (β − 1) − 12 g = 0. Thus, we proved Proposition 2. The symmetry (9) with k = 1 admits a non-abelianization iff β = 0, ±1, ±2. (13) Remark 1. The class of systems of the form (11) is invariant under the matrix transposition τ(u) = u T , τ(v) = v T . Under this transposition the parameter β changes as follows τ(β) = −β. Therefore, there exist three non-equivalent systems with β = −2, −1, 0. The Hamiltonian non-commutative system (see [12, 5]) corresponds to β = 0. 6The same set (13) of admissible values of the parameter β was obtained in [3], where matrix Painlev´e-2 systems satisfying the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test were investigated. Notice that in the approach related to the test it is crucial that u and v are matrices (of an arbitrary size), while the above considerations can be generalized to the non-abelian case without any changes. 2.1.3 Non-abelianization of Lax representations The non-abelianization of the Lax representation (10) gives rise to the Lax pair L(λ) = −4 0 λ 2 + 0 4u 4u λ + 2u 2 + z −2u2 + 2v − z 2u 2 − 2v + z −2u2 − z + 0 κ κ λ − , M(λ) = 1 0 − λ + −β u −u −u −β u . for auxiliary autonomous system (11). It turns out that the non-abelian symmetry described above has the Lax representation with the same L-operator and M1(λ) = [u, v] 0 [u, v] λ 2 + Ω1 [u, [u, v]] − [u, [u, v]] −Ω λ + Ω2 + 2Ω3 Ω Ω2 Ω2 + 2Ω , where Ω1 = −u v − vu2 + v 2 − 2κu − zv, Ω2 = u vu + uvu2 − uv2 + vuv − v 2u + 2κu2 + z(uv + vu), Ω3 = −a1u v − (a1 + a2)u vu − (a1 + a2 + a3)uvu2 + 1 − Xai vu3 − c1uv2 + f1u + − 2 − c vuv + (−c1 − c3)v 2u + −e1 − κ v + z −g1uv + 2 − g1 − g vu. The coefficients of Ω3 are expressed through β in Subsection 2.1.2. In the commutative case, the operator M1 coincides with HM. The relation [∂t − M, ∂t1 − M1] = 0 is equivalent to condition (13). 3 The autonomous systems of Painlev´e-6 type In the Painlev´e-6 case, we follow the line of the previous section. However, the computations become extremely laborious. In particular, the ansatz for non-abelian symmetry contains about 1000 undetermined coefficients. The following trick turns out to be very helpful: we succeeded to find the leading coefficients of the non-abelian system investigating separately the homogeneous system generated by the leading parts. In the scalar case, the auxiliary autonomous system has the form    du dt = 2u 3v − 2u2v − κ1u2 + κ2u + z −2u 2v + 2uv + κ4u + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4) , dv dt = −3u 2v2 + 2uv2 + 2κ1uv − κ2v + κ3 + z 2uv2 − v 2 − κ4v , (14) where z ∈ C and κi are arbitrary parameters. The Hamiltonian H for (14) is given by H = H1 + z H2, 7with H1 = u v 2 − u v 2 − κ1u v + κ2uv − κ3u, H2 = −u v 2 + uv2 + κ4uv + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)v. The non-abelianization of (14) is a system of the form (2), where Pi and Qi are noncommutative polynomials given by P1(u, v) = a1u v + a2u vu + a3uvu2 + (2 − a1 − a2 − a3)vu3 + c1u v + (−2 − c1 − c2)uvu + c2vu2 − κ1u 2 + κ2u, Q1(u, v) = f1u v + (−2 − f1 − f2)uvu + f2vu2 + h1uv + (2 − h1)vu + κ4u + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4), P2(u, v) = b1u v 2 + b2uvuv + b3uv2u + b4vu v + b5vuvu + −3 − Xbi v 2u + d1uv2 + (2 − d1 − d2)vuv + d2v 2u + e1uv + (2κ1 − e1)vu − κ2v + κ3, Q2(u, v) = g1uv2 + (2 − g1 − g2)vuv + g2v 2u − v2 − κ4v (15) where ai, bi, ci, di, fi, gi, h1, and e1 belong to C. It is clear that if system (2), (15) possesses integrals, symmetries and Lax representation, then their leading parts define the corresponding objects for its leading homogeneous part. For this reason, we first perform a non-abelianization of the homogeneous part of the scalar autonomous system of Painlev´e-6 type. 3.1 Homogeneous non-abelian systems of Painlev´e-6 type The homogeneous principal part5, ( u ′ = 2u3v, v ′ = −3u2v , (16) of (14) possesses the first integral I = u v . For any N the following system ( uτ = u ′ I N , vτ = v ′ I N (17) is an infinitesimal symmetry of (16). In addition to (17), the system (16) has symmetries ( uτ = u IN , vτ = −2v IN , (18) which are related to the homogeneity of the system. The degrees of the simplest symmetries are equal to 6 and 9. We are going to find all non-abelianizations of system (16) that have non-abelian symmetries of degree 6 and 9. The non-abelianization of (16) is given by    u ′ = a1 u3v + a2 u2vu + a3 uvu2 + (2 − a1 − a2 − a3) vu , v ′ = b1 u2v2 + b2 uvuv + b3 uv2u + b4 vu2v + b5 vuvu + (−3 − b1 − b2 − b3 − b4 − b5) v 2u . (19) 5Here and below we denote t-derivatives by ′ . 8As in the Painlev´e-2 case (see Subsection 2.1.1), we are going to generalize to the non-abelian case several first integrals. It allows us to reduce the number of unknown coefficients in (19). Lemma 1. If the integrals I and I 2 admit a non-abelianization then the system (19) has the form    u ′ = a1 u3v + a2 u2vu + a3 uvu2 + (2 − a1 − a2 − a3) vu , v ′ = −a1 u2v2 + (−a1 − a2) uvuv + (1 − a2 − a3) vu2v + (−2 + a1 + a2) vuvu + (−2 + a1 + a2 + a3) v 2u . (20) Following the line of Subsection 2.1.2, we specify the remaining parameters in (20) by the non-abelianization of symmetries. Proposition 3. If system (20) admits a non-abelianization of symmetries of degrees 6 and 9 then it has one of the following forms (up to the transposition u → u T , v → v T ) Case 1: a1 = a, a2 = 2 − a, a3 = 0, ( u ′ = a u3v + (2 − a) u2vu, v ′ = −a u2v2 − 2uvuv + (−1 + a) vu2v; Case 2: a1 = 0, a2 = a, a3 = 2 − a, ( u ′ = a u2vu + (2 − a) uvu , v ′ = −a uvuv − vu2v + (−2 + a)vuvu, with a = −1, 0, 1, 2 and a = −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. Proof. In the proof, we first find relations between the coefficients of system (20) which is equivalent to the existence of a non-abelianization of the symmetry of degree 6. The non-abelianization ansatz for symmetry (18) with N = 1 is obvious, and we do not present it here. Let us denote the unknown coefficients of the monomials u 2vuvu, uvu2vu, uvuvu2in the ansatz by c1, c2, c3, respectively. The compatibility symmetry condition produces a large system of non-linear algebraic equations. Eliminating variables, we arrive at an autonomous subsystem for the coefficients a1, a2, a3, c1, c2, c3. One of its equations is a1 a3 = 0 which leads to two different cases. If a1 = 0, then the subsystem is equivalent to (a2 + a3 − 2) c2 = 0, (a2 − 2) a2 − (a3 − 2) a3c2 = 0, a3 ((a3 − 2) c2 + a2) = 0, (a3 − 2) a3 (c2 − 1) c2 = 0, (a3 − 1) c3 = 0, c3 (a2 − c2) = 0, (c2 − 1) c2c3 = 0. This system has the following solution a3 = 2 − a, a2 = a, c2 = 1, c3 = 0, where a is an arbitrary parameter. In the case a3 = 0, we obtain the following system (a1 − a2) (a1 + a2 − 2) = 0, a2 (a1 + a2 − 2) = 0, (a1 − 1) c1 = 0, (a2 − 1) c1 = 0, a1c2 = 0, c1c2 = 0, (a2 − 2) c2 = 0, c3 = 0. 9The first two equations give a2 = 2 − a, a1 = a. To specify an arbitrary parameter a, we use a non-abelian symmetry of degree 9. Let us consider the compatibility condition and denote the unknown coefficients related to the symmetry that cannot be determined uniquely from this condition by d1 and d2. Then, in Case 1, these monomials are d1 u 3vu2vuv, d2 u3vuvu2v and one can obtain a system that is equivalent to d1 − (a − 1)d2 = 0, (d2 − 1) d2 = 0, d1 (d2 − 1) = 0, a 2 + a − 4d1 − 2d2 = 0, (d1 − 1) d1 = 0, (a − 2)d1 = 0. So, the solution is one of the following: a = −1, d1 = 0, d2 = 0; a = 0, d1 = 0, d2 = 0; a = 1, d1 = 0, d2 = 1; a = 2, d1 = 1, d2 = 1. Similarly, in Case 2, a reduced system can be written as (d2 − 1) d2 = 0, d1 (d1 + 1) = 0, d2 (a − d1) = 0, d1 (a + 4d2 − 3) = 0, (a − 3)a + 2 (d1 + (d1 − 1) d2 + 1) = 0, where d1 and d2 are coefficients of uvu2vu2vu and uvuvu2vu2, respectively. The system possesses one of the following solutions: a = −1, d1 = −1, d2 = 1; a = 0, d1 = 0, d2 = 1; a = 1, d1 = 0, d2 = 0; a = 2, d1 = 0, d2 = 0; a = 3, d1 = −1, d2 = 0. Therefore, we arrive at the statement of the proposition. Remark 2. Note that Case 1, a = 0 coincides with Case 2, a = 2. Remark 3. The matrix transposition τ : u → u T , v → v T preserves the class of systems (2), (15) and maps integrable systems to integrable. In particular, systems related to Case 2 from Proposition 3 with a = 0 and a = 2 as well as with a = −1 and a = 3 are dual with respect to the transposition. Sometimes we formulate classification statements up to the transposition. 3.2 General case Considering system (2), (15), we obtain the following generalization of Lemma 1: Proposition 4. An autonomous system of the form (2), (15) admits a non-abelianization of the integrals H6 and H iff the polynomials Pi and Qi have the form P1(u, v) = a1 u v + a2 u vu + a3 uvu2 + (2 − a1 − a2 − a3) vu + c1 u v + (−2 − c1 − c2) uvu + c2 vu2 − κ1 u 2 + κ2 u, Q1(u, v) = f1 u v + (−2 − f1 − f2) uvu + f2 vu + h1 uv + (2 − h1) vu + κ4u + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4), (21) 10P2(u, v) = −a1 u v 2 + (−a1 − a2) uvuv + (1 − a2 − a3) vu v + (−2 + a1 + a2) vuvu + (−2 + a1 + a2 + a3) v 2u − c1 uv2 + (2 + c1 + c2) vuv − c2 v 2u + e1 uv + (2κ1 − e1) vu − κ2 v + κ3, Q2(u, v) = −f1 uv2 + (2 + f1 + f2) vuv − f2 v 2u − v2 − κ4 v. (22) As it was mentioned at the beginning of Section 3, if system (15) satisfy Assumption 1, then its leading homogeneous part also satisfies it. Thus, Proposition 3 separates the classification of systems (2), (21), (22) into 9 different cases. We consider each of these cases independently6. An inhomogeneous scalar Painlev´e-6 system does not have symmetry of order 6. Therefore, we consider non-abelianization of the symmetry of order 9. Just as in Subsection 2.1.2, we refine the form of the symmetry, after which about indeterminate coefficients remain in the ansatz for the symmetry. The compatibility condition of the system and symmetry leads to a huge overdetermined system of non-linear algebraic equations with respect to the remaining nine coefficients in the equation and the symmetry coefficients. Despite its size, the system is easily solved using the computer algebra system \"Mathematica\". Theorem 2. A system (2) with (21), (22), whose leading part is decribed by Proposition 3, admits a non-abelianization of the symmetry of degree 9 iff it belong to one of the following lists i) Appendix A.1 from the paper [5], ii) Appendix A.1 from the paper [6], iii) Appendix A.1 in this paper (up to the transposition τ). 4 Autonomous systems of P5 − P1 types 4.1 Systems of P5 type The scalar auxiliary autonomous system of the Painlev´e-5 type is defined by the Hamiltonian H of the form H = u v 2 − 2u v 2 + v2 − κ1u v + (κ1 + κ2)uv − κ2v − κ3u + κ4zuv. (23) A non-abelian generalization of this system can be written as    du dt = a1u 3v + a2u2vu + a3uvu2 + (2 − Pai) vu3 + c1u 2v + (−4 − c1 − c2)uvu + c2vu2 − κ1u 2 + e1uv + (2 − e1)vu + (κ1 + κ2)u − κ2 + κ4zu, dv dt = b1u 2v2 + b2uvuv + b3uv2u + b4vu2v + b5vuvu + (−3 − Pbi) v 2u + d1uv2 + (4 − d1 − d2)vuv − d2v 2u − v2 + f1uv + (2κ1 − f1)vu − (κ1 + κ2)v + κ3 − κ4zv, (24) where ai, bi, ci, di, e1, f1, κi ∈ C. In fact, it suffices to consider 5 cases that are not equivalent with respect to the transposition τ. 11Proposition 5. a) A system of the form (2) admits a non-abelianization of integrals H and H iff b1 = −a1, b2 = −a1 − a2, b3 = 0, b4 = 1 − a2 − a3, b5 = −2 + a1 + a2, d1 = −c1, d2 = −c2. b) If the system additionally admits a non-abelianiazation of the symmetry (5) of degree 9, then it belongs to one of the following lists i) Appendix A.2 from [5], ii) Appendix A.2 from [6], iii) Appendix A.2 in this paper (up to the transposition τ). 4.2 Systems of P4 type The scalar Hamiltonian for an autonomous P4 system is given by H = uv2 − u v + κ2v − κ3u − 2zuv. (25) Then, the general non-abelian autonomous system can be written in the form    du dt = −u 2 + 2uv + α [u, v] − 2zu + κ2, dv dt = −v 2 + 2vu + β [v, u] + 2zv + κ (26) with the parameters α, β ∈ C to be defined. Proposition 6. a) For any parameters α, β the system (2) admits a non-abelianization of the first integrals H and H2. b) The autonomous system possesses a non-abelian symmetry of degree 5 iff it belongs to one of the following lists i) Appendix A.3 from [5], ii) Appendix A.3 from [6], iii) Appendix A.3 (up to the transposition τ). 4.3 P3 type systems In the P3 case, we deal with the Painlev´e- ′ version of the scalar system. The Hamiltonian of the corresponding autonomous system is given by: H = u v 2 + κ2u v + κ1uv + κ3u + κ4zv. (27) A non-abelian generalization of the system can be written as    du dt = a1u 2v + (2 − a1 − a2)uvu + a2vu2 + κ1u + κ2u2 + κ4z, dv dt = b1uv2 − (2 + b1 + b2)vuv + b2v 2u − κ1v + c1uv + (−2κ2 − c1)vu − κ3, (28) where ai, bi, c1, κi ∈ C. 12Proposition 7. a) A system of the form (28) admits a non-abelianization of integrals H and H iff b1 = −a1, b2 = −a2. b) If the system additionally admits a non-abelianiazation of the symmetry (5) of degree 7, then it belongs to one of the following lists i) Appendix A.4 from [5], ii) Appendix A.4 from [6], iii) Appendix A.4 (up to the transposition τ). 4.4 Systems of P2 type These systems were considered in Subsection 2.1 in details. There are three systems nonequivalent with respect to the transposition, which correspond to results of the paper [3] (see also [15]). 4.5 P1 type system In the scalar case, an autonomous system has the form    du dt = v, dv dt = 6u 2 + z. For a non-abelianization of this system we can just replace the variables u and v with noncommutative ones. It turns out that this analog admits Assumption 1. Probably, the corresponding matrix equation Painlev´e-1 first time appeared in the paper [4]. 5 Non-abelian Painlev´e systems Formally, the restoring of a Painlev´e system of the form (1) corresponding to any autonomous system (2) described in Sections 3 and 4 is very simple. We have to replace the time t with z and choose f(z) = z(z − 1) in the P6 case, f(z) = z for P5 and P3 systems, and f(z) = otherwise. The question arises whether these systems are integrable. It is not known whether all of them satisfy the Painlev´e property. However, • all known matrix Painlev´e systems can be obtained in this way; • all these systems possess an isomonodromic Lax representation; • systems of different types are related by limiting transitions in the same way as in the scalar case and can be obtained by degenerations of the P6 systems. 135.1 Transformation groups and their orbits 5.1.1 P6 case The scalar Painlev´e-6 system admits the linear B¨acklund transformations r1 : (z, u, v) 7→ (1 − z, 1 − u, −v), r2 : (z, u, v) 7→ z − , z−1u, zv, which change the parameters as r1 : (κ1, κ2, κ3, κ4) 7→ (κ1, 2κ1 − κ2 − κ4, κ3, κ4), r2 : (κ1, κ2, κ3, κ4) 7→ (κ1, κ4 − 1, κ3, κ2 + 1). These involutions generate a group isomorphic to S3. In the non-abelian case the transposition τ together with the above transformations act on the set of integrable non-abelian Painlev´e-6 systems. The transposition τ changes the parameters in (21), (22) as follows: τ (a1, a2, a3, c1, c2, e1, f1, f2, h1) = (2 − a1 − a2 − a3, a3, a2, c2, c1, 2κ1 − e1, f2, f1, 2 − h1). Systems 1P6 – 8P6 of the P6 type (see Appendix A.1) are non-equivalent with respect to τ. The S3-action on these systems is given by: r1(1P6) = 1P6, r2(1P6) = 1P6, r1(2P6) = 4P6, r2(2P6) = 2P6, r1(3P6) = 3P6, r2(3P6) = 4P6, r1(4P6) = 2P6, r2(4P6) = 3P6, r1(5P6) = 5P6, r2(5P6) = 5P6, r1(6P6) = 8P6, r2(6P6) = 7P6, r1(7P6) = 7P6, r2(7P6) = 6P6, r1(8P6) = 6P6, r2(8P6) = 8P6. Transformations r1, r2 taking together with the transposition τ generate a group isomorphic to S3 × Z2. The action of this group has the following four orbits: Orbit 1 = {1P6, τ(1P6)} , Orbit 2 = {2P6, τ(2P6), 3P6, τ(3P6), 4P6, τ(4P6)} , Orbit 3 = {5P6, τ(5P6)} , Orbit 4 = {6P6, τ(6P6), 7P6, τ(7P6), 8P6, τ(8P6)} . Besides four non-equivalent new systems corresponding to the orbits, we have five nonequivalent systems with the generalized Okamoto integral found in [6] and one Hamiltonian non-abelian system [12, 5]. 5.1.2 P5 case The transposition τ acts on the parameters of system (24) as τ (a1, a2, a3, c1, c2, e1, f1) = (2 − a1 − a2 − a3, a3, a2, c2, c1, 2 − e1, 2κ1 − f1). Its action on the systems from Appendix A.2 forms four orbits: Orbit 1 = {1P5, τ(1P5)} , Orbit 2 = {2P5, τ(2P5)} , Orbit 3 = {3P5, τ(3P5)} , Orbit 4 = {4P5, τ(4P5)} . Thus we have 5 non-equivalent systems obtained in [6], one Hamiltonian system [12, 5] and 4 new systems found in this paper. 145.1.3 P4 case The transposition τ and the involutions s1 (u, v, z) = (iv, iu, −iz), s2 (u, v, z) = (−iu, i(v − u − 2z), −iz) preserve a class of systems of the form (26), changing the parameters as τ (α, β) = (−2 − α, −2 − β), s1 (α, β) = (β, α), s2 (α, β) = (α, −α − β − 3). There are three systems non-equivalent with respect to the group generated by τ, s1, and s2. One of them, Hamiltonian, was found in [12], the second has the Okamoto integral [6], and the third one is presented in Appendix A.3. All of them also arose in the paper [7], where the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test was used for classification (see also [1]). 5.1.4 P3 case The transposition τ acts on the parameters of system (28) in the following way τ (a1, a2, c1) = (a2, a1, −c1 − 2κ2). Appendix A.4 contains two systems non-equivalent with respect to τ. Four systems with the Okamoto integral can be found in [5]. For one more, Hamiltonian system, see [12, 5]. 5.1.5 P2 case There are three systems non-equivalent with respect to the transposition, which correspond to results of the paper [3] (see also [15]). 5.1.6 P1 case. There is only one matrix P1 system (see section 4.5). Being Hamiltonian, it is invariant with respect to the transposition τ. 5.2 Isomonodromic representations All scalar Painlev´e systems admit an isomonodromic representation [9, 10] of the form (4). Note that for commuting variables u and v the relation (4) admits shifts of the form B 7→ B + q(z, u, v) I, (29) where q is an arbitrary polynomial in u and v, while in the non-commutative case such transformations are not allowed. Using the non-abelianization procedure proposed in [7], we generalize well-known isomonodromic pairs for the scalar P6 − P1 systems to the non-abelian case. As a result, we obtain Lax pairs not only for specific Painlev´e-type systems with auxiliary autonomous systems listed in Sections 3 and 4, but for whole classes of systems satisfying the property 3 in Assumption 1 (see Proposition 4 and item a) in Propositions 5 – 7). The non-abelianization procedure is based on the observation that most of Lax pairs for scalar Painlev´e type systems are homogeneous in the following sense. If we represent A and B as rational functions in λ, z, and κi with coefficients being 2 × 2 matrices polynomial in u and v, then these coefficients turn out to be homogeneous for proper weights of u and v (see the next section for details). 155.2.1 Systems of P6 type The Lax representation (4) for the commutative P6 system (14) found in [10] is defined by A(z, λ) = A0(z) λ + A1(z) λ − + A2(z) λ − z , B(z, λ) = B0(z) − A2(z) λ − z , (30) where the matrices A0(z), A1(z), A2(z), and B0(z) are equivalent to A0 = −1 − κ1 + κ4 uz−1 − 0 , A1 = −uv + κ1 −u 2v2 + κ1uv + κ3 uv , A2 = uv + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4) −uz− zuv2 + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)zv −uv , B0 = (z(z − 1))− 2u 2v − κ1u − z (2uv + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)) −uv2 − (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)v ! . If we assign the weights w(u) = w(v) = 1 to the variables, then any matrix coefficient Q(u, v) has homogeneous entries qij such that w(q11) = w(q22) = w(q12) + 2 = w(q21) − 2. Under the non-abelianization we preserve the same structure of A and B in λ, z, and κi and the homogeneity property. Besides, we require the in the scalar limit the pair coincides with the described above up to a transformation of the form (29). Proposition 8. Any non-abelian system of the P6 type described in Proposition 4, is equivalent to the zero-curvature condition (4) with matrices A(z, λ) and B(z, λ) of the form (30), where A0 = −1 − κ1 + κ4 uz−1 − 0 , A1 = −vu + κ1 −vuvu + κ1vu + κ3 vu , A2 = vu + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4) −uz− z v2u + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)zv −vu , B0 = (z(z − 1))− uvu + vu2 − κ1u − z (2vu + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)) −v 2u − (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)v ! + q(z, u, v) I, z(z − 1) q(z, u, v) = −a1u v − (a1 + a2)uvu + (1 − a1 − a2 − a3)vu2 − c1uv + (1 + c2)vu + e1u + z (−f1uv + (2 + f2)vu − h1v). In the scalar case the polynomial q can be removed by shift (29). 5.2.2 Systems of P5 type The Painlev´e-5 system associated with the Hamiltonian (23) admits an isomonodromic Lax pair of the form A(λ, z) = A0(z) + A1(z) λ + A2(z) λ − , B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z), (31) where [10] A0 = κ4z 0 , A1 = −uv + κ1 −u 2v2 + κ1uv + κ3 uv , A2 = uv − κ2 −u uv2 − κ2v −uv , 16B1 = κ4 0 , B0 = z − 2u 2v − 2uv − κ1u + κ1 −u + −u 2v2 + uv2 + κ1uv − κ2v + κ3 . This Lax pair can be generalized to the non-abelian case as follows Proposition 9. Let a non-abelian system of the P5 type possesses an auxiliary autonomous system described in the item a) of Proposition 5. Then it has an isomonodromic Lax pair of the form (31) with matrices A0 = κ4z 0 , A1 = −vu + κ1 −vuvu + κ1vu + κ3 vu , A2 = vu − κ2 −u v 2u − κ2v −vu , B1 = κ4 0 , B0 = z − uvu + vu2 − 2vu − κ1u + κ1 −u + −vuvu + v 2u + κ1vu − κ2v + κ3 + q(z, u, v) I, z q(z, u, v) = −a1u v − (a1 + a2)uvu + (1 − a1 − a2 − a3)vu2 − c1uv + (3 + c2)vu + f1u − e1v. 5.2.3 Systems of P4 type The Hamiltonian (25) leads to the Painlev´e-4 system. Its well-known [10] that this system is equivalent to the zero-curvature condition (4) with A(λ, z) = A1λ + A0(z) + A−1(z)λ − , B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z), (32) where the matrices A1, A0(z), A−1(z), B1, and B0(z) are given by A1 = −2 0 , A0 = −2z uv + κ3 , A−1 = uv + κ2 −u uv2 + κ2v −uv , B1 = −2 0 , B0 = −u − 2z uv + κ3 . According to the item a) from Proposition 6, non-abelian systems of the P4 type associated with (26) admit the non-abelianization of the first integrals. One can verify that they also have an isomonodromic representation. Proposition 10. For any α, β ∈ C, a non-abelian P4 type system defined by the autonomous system (26) has a Lax pair of the form (32), where A1 = −2 0 , A0 = −2z vu + κ3 , A−1 = vu + κ2 −u v 2u + κ2v −vu , B1 = −2 0 , B0 = −u − 2z vu + κ3 + q(z, u, v) I, q(z, u, v) = −βu − (α + 2)v. 175.2.4 P3 type systems The scalar P ′ system related to Hamiltonian (27) has (see [10]) the following isomonodromic Lax pair A(λ, z) = A0(z) + A−1(z)λ −1 + A−2(z)λ− , B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z), (33) where the matrices A0(z), A−1(z), A−2(z), B1, and B0(z) are equivalent to A0 = κ4z 0 , A−1 = − κ1 u uv2 + κ1v + κ2uv + κ3 , A−2 = v + κ2 − v 2 + κ2v −v , B1 = κ4 0 , B0 = z − 2uv + κ2u −u − uv2 + κ1v + κ2uv + κ ! . Proposition 11. Suppose that a non-abelian system of the P ′ type has an auxiliary autonomous system given by the item a) of Proposition 7. Then it is equivalent to (4), where a Lax pair has the form (33) with A0 = κ4z 0 , A−1 = − κ1 u vuv + κ1v + κ2vu + κ3 , A−2 = v + κ2 − v 2 + κ2v −v , B1 = κ4 0 , B0 = z − uv + vu + κ2u −u − (vuv + κ1v + κ2vu + κ3) + q(z, u, v) I, z q(z, u, v) = −a1uv + (a2 − 1)vu + c1u. Special cases of P ′ type systems are considered in Appendix B. 5.2.5 Systems of P2 type The commutative Painlev´e-2 system (7) possesses an isomonodromic Lax pair of the form [10] A(λ, z) = A2λ 2 + A1(z)λ + A0(z), B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z), (34) where the matrices A2, A1(z), A0(z), B1, and B0(z) are equivalent to the following: A2 = 2 0 , A1 = 0 − −v , A0 = −v + z −2u uv + κ v , B1 = 1 0 , B0 = −u − − v . Proposition 12. Any non-abelian system of the P2 corresponding to autonomous system (11), is equivalent to the zero-curvature condition (4) with matrices A(z, λ) and B(z, λ) of the form (34), where A2 = 2 0 , A1 = 0 − −v , A0 = −v + z −2u vu + κ v , B1 = 1 0 , B0 = −u − − v + q(z, u, v) I, q(z, u, v) = (1 − β)u. 18Remark 4. Here and in Subsection 2.1, we considered the Lax pairs of Jimbo-Miwa [10] and the Flaschka-Newell types for the Painlev´e-2 equation. It was shown in [17, 11] that in the scalar case these Lax pairs are related to each other by a generalized Laplace transform supplemented with a gauge transformation. Formally, assuming the cancellation of terms that arise from the integration by parts, it is easy to verify that this correspondence can be generalized to the non-abelian case. 5.2.6 P1 type system The P1 system has the Lax pair given by A(λ, z) = A2λ 2 + A1(z)λ + A0(z), B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z) with A2 = 0 2 , A1 = 0 − −2u , A0 = −v −2u 2u 2 + z v , B1 = 0 1 , B0 = 0 − −2u . It can be generalized to the non-abelian case by replacing the variables u and v with noncommutative ones. 5.3 Tree of degenerations In [6] limiting transitions for non-abelian Painlev´e-type systems having Okamoto integrals were found. The same formulas with minor changes in constants can be applied for systems from the current paper . The degeneration trees for P6 systems 1P6 – 8P6 from Appendix A.1 non-equivalent with respect to the transposition τ are shown schematically in Figures 1, 2, and 3. 4P 1P ′ 3P 2P ′ 1P6 1P 1P 2P P H 2P 1P ′ 5P 8P ′ 5P6 3P 1P 1P P H Figure 1: Degenerations of 1P6 and 5P 8P ′ 3P 1P ′ 3P 9P 2P 4P 3P 2P 1P2 P H Figure 2: Degenerations of 2P6, 3P6, and 4P In particular, one should replace κ3 with κ for the P2 systems. 19P ′ H 6P 1P ′ 5P 7P 7P P H 1P P H 6P 2P ′ 1P 8P ′ 1P 8P6 4P P H 1P P H Figure 3: Degenerations of 6P6, 7P6, and 8P The bold font in iPk denotes the Painlev´e systems from Appendices A.1 – A.5, the thin font is used for systems with Okamoto integrals, and the Hamiltonian systems are denoted as PH k . In order to get degeneracies for the systems, obtained by the transposition from the systems from Appendix A.1, we need to replace each system in Figures 1 – 3 with its transposed version. We see that the trees corresponding to P6 systems from different orbits (see Subsection 5.1.1) have no intersections. All 18 systems listed in the appendices are presented in Figures 1 – 3. No additional new systems were obtained by degenerations, so the class of systems found in this paper is closed with respect to the limiting transitions. These limiting transitions can be also extended to the Lax pairs. In most cases, formulas from Subsection 4.1 in [6] are applicable, but in the cases P5 → P ′ 3 and P4 → P2 it is necessary to supplement them with a gauge transformation A˜ (z, λ) = g A(z, λ) g −1 + ∂λg g− , B˜ (z, λ) = g B(z, λ) g −1 + ∂zg g− , where g = z µ I and g = zµ ε− I, respectively. The constant µ depends on the choice of a particular system of P5 or P4 type. 6 Conclusion We found all non-abelian Painlev´e systems whose auxiliary autonomous systems have first integrals and symmetries. We believe that these systems enjoy the Painlev´e property. It was shown in [4, 3, 7] that in the P1, P2, and P4 cases they satisfy the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test. We constructed isomonodromic Lax pairs for multiparametric families of P2 – P6 systems containing all the systems obtained in this paper. As long as we assume that the coefficients of non-abelian polynomials are scalar constants, all systems are GL(m) invariant and we may consider their restriction on the invariants of GL(m)-action. It turns out that all restricted systems of the above families coincide with each other. A comparison of the results from [7] and Subsection 5.2.3 shows that in order to choose from these families those systems that have the Painlev´e property, one can assume the existence of symmetries for the auxiliary autonomous systems. The situation changes drastically if the constant coefficients themselves are non-abelian. Examples of such Painlev´e systems were found in [4, 15, 2, 7, 5]. We hope that a systematic construction of such systems can be carried out by simultaneous non-abelianization of the coefficients of the autonomous systems found in this paper and their symmetries. We are going to devote a separate paper to the search for systems of the Painlev´e type with non-abelian coefficients and the study of the properties of the corresponding autonomous systems. 20Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to V.

The corresponding scalar autonomous system is Hamiltonian with H = u v 2 + κ2u v + κ1uv + κ3u + κ4zu−1. (35) A non-abelian generalization of the autonomous system reads as    du dt = a1u 2v + (2 − a1 − a2)uvu + a2vu2 + κ1u + κ2u , dv dt = b1uv2 − (2 + b1 + b2)vuv + b2v 2u − κ1v + c1uv + (−2κ2 − c1)vu − κ3 + κ4zu−2, (36) where ai, bi, c1, κi ∈ C. Proposition 13. a) A system of the form (36) admits a non-abelianization of integrals H and H iff b1 = −a1, b2 = −a2. b) If the system additionally possesses a non-abelianization of the symmetry (5) of degree 7, then it belongs to one of the following lists: i) Appendix A.7 from [5], 23ii) Appendix C.1 from [6], iii) (up to the transposition τ) ( u ′ = 2u v + κ1u + κ2u , v ′ = −2uv2 − κ1v − 3κ2uv + κ2vu − κ3 + κ4zu− ; 1P ′ (D7) ( u ′ = 2u2v + κ1u + κ2u , v ′ = −2uv2 − κ1v − κ2uv − κ2vu − κ3 + κ4zu− . 2P ′ (D7) The transposition τ acts on the parameters of system (36) as follows τ (a1, a2, c1) = (a2, a1, −c1 − 2κ2). Systems from the list iii) are non-equivalent with respect to τ. There non-equivalent systems with Okamoto integral were obtained in [6]. One Hamiltonian system can be found in [5]. The P ′ (D7) system related to Hamiltonian (35) has an isomonodromic Lax pair [10] of the form (33). Matrices A0(z), A−1(z), A−2(z), B1, and B0(z) are equivalent to A0 = 0 κ4 zu−1 , A−1 = − uv + κ1 u κ2uv + κ3 −uv , A−2 = −κ2 0 , B1 = 0 κ4 z , B0 = z − κ2u −u 0 . One can generalize this pair to the non-commutative case for non-abelian Painlev´e- ′ (D7) systems satisfying the item 3 from Assumption 1 as follows. Proposition 14. Suppose that a non-abelian system of the P ′ (D7) type admits an auxiliary autonomous system defined by the item a) from Proposition 13. Then it is equivalent to (4), where the Lax pair has the form (33) with A0 = 0 κ4 zu−1 , A−1 = − uv + κ1 u κ2vu + κ3 −vu , A−2 = −κ2 0 , B1 = 0 κ4 u −1 , B0 = z − κ2u −u 0 + q(z, u, v) I, z q(z, u, v) = −a1uv + a2vu + c1u.

      "1. Introduction Shuo-Yen et al. [1] prove constructively that by linear coding alone, the rate at which a message reaches each node can achieve the individual max-flow bound. Also, provide realization of transmission scheme and practically construct linear coding approaches for both cyclic and acyclic networks. [16] shows that network coding is necessity to multicast two bits per unit time from a source to destinations. It also showed that the output flow at a given node is obtained as a linear combination of its input flows. The content of any information flowing out of a set of non-source nodes can be derived from the accumulated information that has flown into the set of nodes. Shuo-Yen et al. described an approach on network information flow and improved the performance in data broadcasting in allto-all communication in order to increase the capacity or the throughput of the network. [7] selected the linear coefficients in a finite field of opportune size in a random way. In this paper packetizing and buffering are explained in terms of encoding vector and buffering the received packets. It showed that each node sends packets obtained as a random linear combination of packets stored in its buffer and each node receives packets which are linear combinations of source packets and it stores them into a matrix. While Widmer et. al. [8] gave an approach with energy efficient broadcasting in network coding. Subsequent work by Fragouli et. al. [9] gave two heuristics and stated that each node in the graph is associated with a forwarding factor. A source node transmits its source symbols (or packets) with some parameters bounded by this forwarding factor. And when a node receives an innovative symbol, it broadcast a linear combination over the span of the received coding vector. [10] deals with network coding of a single message over an acyclic network. Network coding over undirected networks was introduced by [11] and this work was followed by [12], [13]. The network codes that involve only linear mapping with a combination of global and local encoding mapping involves linear error-correction code [14], [15], [16] and [17] have also been presented. We present an approach for parallel network in which network coding is employed to perform communication amid the nodes. The association among network coding and communication algorithm establishes a more efficient way to transfer data among the nodes. We consider parallel multi-source multicast framework with correlated sources on MMT architecture [18]. We use a randomized approach in which, other than the receiving nodes all nodes perform random linear mapping from inputs on outputs (see figure 1). In each incoming transmissions from source node, the destination node has knowledge of overall linear combination of that data set from source. This information is updated at each coding node, by applying the same linear mapping to the coefficient vectors as applied to the information signals. As an example, assume that in a directed parallel network (Ň) the source node Þ1 (unique node, without any incoming at that instant of time) sends a set of two bits (đ1, đ2) to node Þ2, Þ3 and Þ4, Þ7 (figure 1). Network (Ň) in figure 1 is used to show information multicast with network coding at each node. Node Þ multicast data set (đ1, đ2) to destination nodes Þ3 and Þ7. Any receiving non-destination node, truncheons randomly chosen coefficient of finite fields with the received data before transferring to other nodes. The compressive transmission throughout network (Ň) is heralded in following steps of Table 1. IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May ISSN (Online): 1694www.IJCSI.org Fig. 1.A network (Ň) used, as an example, to explain LNC with coefficient added at each data transfer from different nodes (the network has seven nodes Þ1, Þ2...Þ7 and nine edges Þ1 Þ2, Þ1 Þ4, Þ2 Þ5, Þ4 Þ5, Þ Þ3, Þ5 Þ6, Þ4 Þ5, Þ6 Þ3, Þ6 Þ7 directed in this order). (đ1, đ2) is the set of data being multicast to destinations, and coefficients ζ1, ζ2…ζ6 are randomly chosen elements of a finite field. Each link represents the data transmission.

It is also right to say that the flow of information and flow of physical commodities are two different things [1]. So, the coding of information does not increase the information content. The capacity of a network to transmit information from the source to destination can become higher if the coding scheme becomes wider but it is limited to max-flow for a very wide coding scheme [1]. Now, as parallel networks contribute in data communication within several nodes in parallel, it is required to have higher capacity of such networks to transmit information. In senseto increase capacity of data communication in parallel networks we have implemented network coding on parallel architecture (MMT). To examine the performance of this network with network coding we have implemented this approach with existing All-to-All Broadcast algorithm (AAB) [19] on this architecture. In consecutive sections we have also shown that this approach has reduced the chance of error and increased the capacity of network to transmit data between nodes. For parallel transmission of information linearity of coding makes encoding (at source) and decoding (at receiving end) easy to contrivance. We do not address the problem which may or may not occur because of this approach, but have identified the possibilities of errors after implementation. The remaining paper is organized in five sections. In section second our basic model and preliminaries are illustrated. In basic model, notions used for linear–code multicast in parallel architecture (LCM-PA) and definitions are explained. In section third, implementation of AAB on parallel network-MMT is explained. In section forth, LNC is implemented using LCM-PA, it is illustrated using AAB algorithm on MMT [19]. The fifth section is used for results and simulations. In section sixth, we are concluding this paper and future scope of LCM-PA is given in this section. The basic definition, theorems and lemma used in this paper are explained in appendix. 2. Model and Preliminaries A parallel network is represented as a directed graph G (V, E), where V is the set of nodes in network and E is the set of links, such that, from node i to j for all (i, j)אE, where node i and j are called the origin and destination, respectively, of link (i, j), information can be sent noiselessly. Each link l א E is associated with a nonnegative real number cl representing its transmission capacity in bits per unit time. The origin and destination of a link lא E are denoted as o(l) and d(l), respectively, where o(l) ≠ d(l) ׊ l א E is obtained as a coding function of information received at o(l). There are r discrete memoryless information source processes X1, X2...Xr, which are random binary sequences. The processors may change according to the parallel architecture. We denote the Slepian–Wolf region of the sources ࣬SW = ൛ሺܴ1 , ܴ2 ,…,ܴrሻ : ∑௜אௌ ܴi > H ሺܺS |ܺௌ೎ሻ ׊ ܵ ك ሼ1, 2, … , ݎ ሽൟ Where, XS = ൫ܺi , ܺi2,…,ܺi|S|൯, ݅k אS, k = 1… |S|. Source process Xi is generated at node a(i), and multi-cast to all nodes j א b(i), where a : { 1,…, r} → V and b : {1,…, r} → 2V are arbitrary mappings. For parallel architectures, we have considered the same approach to implement the network coding. In this paper, we consider the (multisource) multicast case where b(i) = {β1,…, βd} for all iא] 1, r]. The node a(1),…, a(r) are called source nodes and the β1,…, βd are called receiver nodes, or receivers. For simplicity, we assume subsequently that a(i) ≠ βj׊iא [1, r], jא] 1, d]. For data communication at different step, the source and destination nodes changes according to the flow of data in the algorithm. If the receiving node is able to encode the complete source information, than connection requirements are fulfilled. For parallel communication, we have used these sets of connection requirements for level of communication, which is encoded at each level (step of algorithm). To specify a multicast connection problem we used 1) a graph G (V, E), 2) a set of multicast connection requirements, and 3) a set Þ ζ5(ζ1đ1+ζ2đ2) + ζ6 (ζ3đ1+ζ4đ2) ζ1đ1+ζ2đ Þ1 ζ3đ1+ζ4đ (đ1, đ2) Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ6IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May ISSN (Online): 1694www.IJCSI.org of link capacity {cl | l א E}.To explain linear–code multicast (LCM) with parallel communication network, we present some terminologies, definitions and assumptions. Conventions: 1) In MMT network, the edges e.g., (Þ1, Þ2) א)E) denotes that (Þ1, Þ2) is a bi-directed edge [18], but this edge may act as unidirectional depending on the algorithm. 2) The information unit is taken as a symbol in the base field, i.e., 1 symbol in the base field can be transmitted on a channel every unit time [1]. Definitions: 1) The communication in MMT network is interblock and intrablock [18]. LNC is implemented in blocks first and then in complete network. 2) A LCM on a communication network (G, o(l)) is an assignment of vector space v (Þi) to every node Þi and a vector v (Þi, Þj) to every edge Þi, Þj [1] such that v(o(l)) = Ω; v(Þi, Þj) א v (Þi) for every edge Þi, Þj; for any collection א d(l) of nonsource nodes in the network ۃሼݒሺÞ1ሻ: Þ1 א ݀ሺ݈ሻሽۄ ൌ ۃሼݒሺÞi, Þj ሻ: Þi ב݀ሺ݈ሻ, Þj א ݀ሺ݈ሻሽۄ Assumptions: 1) Each source process Xi has one bit per unit time entropy rate for independent source process, while larger rate sources are modeled as multiple sources. 2) Modeling of sources as linear combinations of independent source processes for linearly correlated sources. 3) Links with lא E is supposed having a capacity cl of one bit per unit time for both independent as well as linear correlated sources. 4) Both cyclic (networks with link delays because of information buffering at intermediate nodes; operated in a batched [2] fashion, burst [11], or pipelined [12]) and acyclic networks (networks whose nodes are delay-free i.e. zero-delay) are considered for implementation of LNC on parallel networks, by analyzing parallel network to be a cyclic or acyclic. 5) We are repeatedly using either of these terms processor and nodes, throughout the paper, which signify common significance. The network may be analyzed to be acyclic or cyclic using scalar algebraic network coding framework [13]. Let us consider the zero-delay case first, by representing the equation ܻj ൌ ∑ሼ௜:௔ሺ௜ሻ ୀ௢ሺ௝ሻሽ ܽi, j ܺi ൅ ∑ ݂l,j ܻl. ሼ௟:ௗሺ௟ሻୀ௢ሺ௝ሻሽ The sequence of length-u blocks or vectors of bits, which are treated as elements of a finite field Fq, q = 2u . The information process Yj transmission on a link j is formed as a linear combination, in Fq, of link j's inputs, i.e., source processes Xi for which a(i) = o(j) and random processes Yl for which d(l) = o(j).

Memory is needed, for link delays on network for multicast, at receiver (or source) nodes, but a memoryless operation suffices at all other nodes [12].

This shows that maxflow(Þ3) is an upper bound on the amount of information received at Þ3 when a LCM ߰ is used [1]. 3. Implementation of AAB on Parallel Network In this section, we implement AAB on parallel network (MMT). For implementation, we are using AAB algorithm, which involves ten steps to completely transfer and receive information of all processors to all processors in MMT [19] and implement LNC using LCM-PA model in next section. We consider the MMT network with n = 8, where n is number of processors and in algorithm and we consider N= n ൈn2, nN and a block = nൈn= row× column. The time taken to transfer and receive all information at each step of algorithm is listed in [19] involved in AAB algorithm. For implementation of AAB on MMT network, first we state a reason for using this network. MMT network is better than other traditional parallel networks (we compared few of them e.g., Multi-Mesh (MM) [20, 21]) based on the topological properties of MMT, which is comparable regarding efficiency parameters. A comparison of these networks, based on some parameters, is given in figure 4 and a comparison between 2D Sort on MM and MMT for different values of processor is given in figure 5. Fig. 4.

From all these network architectures MMT is more optimum network to be used. Table 2: Characteristics of Various Processor Organizations.

For clarity in explaining each step of algorithm, we have used either one row or one column, based on the algorithm, to show the flow of data in each step. For every step the data flow varies, so for each step different algorithms are used. Figure 6 shows first row in first block of the network and the connectivity between the processors is based on the topological properties of MMT [18]. We have considered that each processor is having a Working Array (WA) which consist of the processor index (Pn) and information associated with that processor (In). The size of working array is based on the size of network used, i.e. for n = 8, the size of WA = 8. 0. 1. 2. 3.

Implementing LNC on AAB using MMT In this section we implement network coding for each step to make the communication faster and increase the rate of information transmitted from each node. We consider network as delay-free (acyclic) and o(l) ≠ d(l). The algorithm results are analyzed later with n= 8 processors. For each step independent and different algorithms are used (see section IV) and linear coding is implemented with each algorithm. According to algorithm 1, data from IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May ISSN (Online): 1694www.IJCSI.org ζ2đ7+ ζ3đ6 + ζ6đ ζ4đ ζ3đ ζ2đ ζ1đ đ1 đ2 đ3 đ4 đ5 đ6 đ7 đ đ1 đ2 đ3 đ ζ1đ8+ ζ5đ đ ζ2đ7+ ζ3đ6 + ζ6đ3 ζ1đ8+ ζ4đ5 + ζ5đ4 + ζ7đ đ all processors are transferred with n = 8 and count = 1 to i.e, ሺ8/ሺ2 ൈ 1 – 1ሻሻ <݆  ሺ8/2 ൈ 1ሻ ൌ 8 <݆  4 , which means the processors Þ1, Þ2, Þ3 and Þ4 will receive data from Þ5, Þ6, Þ7 and Þ8, shown in figure 10.

(b) Shows the direction of flow of data in step 1 of AAB algorithm on MMT, Þ1, Þ2, Þ3and Þ4 are the processor receiving data and Þ5, Þ6, Þ7 and Þ8 are the sending processors. The dotted line distinguishes between the receiving and sending processors in first iteration of step 1. Step 1: Linear coding is implemented on Þ1, Þ2 and Þ3processors, as these are receiving a set of data form source processors Þ5, Þ6, Þ7 and Þ8 in first iteration. Processor Þ8 is source and Þ4 is its destination; Þ7 and Þ are sources and Þ3 is their destination; lastly in logn iteration i.e. (3 iteration for n = 8), Þ1 will receive data from Þ2 and Þ3. After implementation of LNC according to LCM-PA on these sources and destinations, step 1 will work as in figure 11. During first iteration of AAB on MMT, LCM-PA will work as in figure 11 (a). Data from Þ5, Þ6, Þ7 and Þ8 is sent to Þ2, Þ3, Þ3 and Þ4 respectively. So, the complete set of data from all processors reached processor Þ1,i.e. after execution of step 1 all data, in a row, will reach its root processors, but due to LCM-PA the data reached Þ1 will have time complexity of ሺlog݊ െ 1ሻ, as one step is reduced during transfer of the data using LCM-PA model. Þ1 Þ2 Þ3 Þ4 Þ5 Þ6 Þ7 Þ (a) Þ1 Þ2 Þ3 Þ (b) Þ1 Þ (c) Fig. 11. (a) Iteration first of step 1; data from processers Þ5, Þ6,Þ7 andÞ8is sent to processors to Þ4,Þ3, Þ3 and Þ2 respectively. (b) Iteration second of step 1; data from processers Þ4 and Þ3is sent to processors to Þ2and Þ1respectively. (c) Iteration third of step 1; data from processers Þ2 is sent to processors Þ1. Step 2: The root processors of each row, ( Þ1 : root processor of first block and first row) will broadcast the data (from Þ1: ζ1đ8+ ζ2đ7 + ζ3đ6 +ζ4đ5 + ζ5đ4 + ζ6đ3 + ζ7đ2) to all the processors of respective row using intrablock links transfer, see figure 12. Fig. 12. The data from each row root processor is broadcasted to other processors of respective row in each block. The time complexity for this step will be reduced by n i.e., n(logn-1). This step is a broadcasting step in each block with intrablock links of MMT. At the end of this step, complete data from root processor is received by otherprocessors of that row. LCM-PA is applied at the same level as in step 1, but the size of data increases to n. Step 3: This step is similar to step 1, but in this step the data is broadcasted in column-wise order of each block. Linear coding is implemented on Þ11, Þ12 and Þ13processors, as these are receiving a set of data form source processors Þ15, Þ16, Þ17 and Þ18 in first iteration. Processor Þ18 is source and Þ14 is its destination; Þ17 and Þ16 are sources and Þ13 is their destination; lastly in logn iteration i.e. (3 iteration for n = 8), Þ11 will receive data from Þ12 and Þ13. After implementation LCM-PA on these sources and destinations, step 3 works as in figure 13. Step 4: In this step all the root processors of each column and each block, (Þ11: root processor of first block and first column) will broadcast the data (from Þ11: ζ1đ18+ ζ2đ17+ ζ3đ16+ ζ4đ15+ ζ5đ14 + ζ6đ13+ ζ7đ12) to all the processors of respective column using intrablock links transfer, see figure 14. The time complexity of this step is reduced by n2 i.e, n (logn-1) = n2logn-n2. The coefficient value (ζi) in step 4 is different from the coefficient value in step 1. Step 5: After step 4, each processors of respective columns contains information of all processors of that column. The step 5, perform the interblock communication using the horizontal interblock links which transfers this information (of all the blocks of respective rows) to the root processors (of respective block), and this requires one communication step (CS) [19]. The time complexity of this step will be same as of AAB i.e. 1CS.

Results and Simulations The implementation of linear coding using AAB on MMT enables the sharing of data between multiple processors, at a time unit, more convenient and easy. As the algorithm becomes more complex, the involvement of processors also increases. For parallel architectures, important issue is to make these architectures more processor utilitarian, otherwise the processors in these architectures are idle, and all are not in use at every step of algorithms. Also, the involvement of coefficients used to broadcast data is high, compared to coefficients involvement after implementation of LCM-PA with AAB on MMT. This makes the algorithm less complex as fewer amounts of coefficients are used for broadcasting data using linear coding. While broadcasting the data in AAB, the time involved to communicate and deliver/receive data from different processors is more. The fall of time complexity at different number of processors shows that the architecture is possible with a set of processors having a combination which makes the algorithm to be implemented with positive results. The algorithm starts with the execution of each step in the order defined (as step 1... step 10), as the execution of each step starts the involvement of each processors also increases to broadcast data. In parallel processing the algorithm starts with active processor and involves other processors as it progresses [22]. Figure 15 illustrate the involvement of processors with average percentage of iteration in each step. Fig. 15.

The algorithm with LCM-PA approach, utilizes the maximum number of processors compared to without LCM-PA approach. So the utilization of processors in parallel architectures is also increases while using linear coding. 6. Conclusion and Future Work We have presented a LCM-PA, model of linear coding, on parallel architecture with efficient implementation of our approach on AAB algorithm on MMT, with comparative time complexity after implementation with LCM-PA. Our model is network independent and can be implemented on any parallel architecture with assumptions to be common as we have used in section second.Future work includes extensions to this approach and analyzing the complexity aspects by implementing with other parallel algorithms (e.g. Multi-Sort [23]). In addition, to make the extension of this approach with LCM-PA model it is needed to be implemented with other parallel algorithms to make vision of research more clear.

A parallel network in any of the phase of communication is said to be directed based on the flow of data with respect to the algorithm. Proof. A parallel network is said to be directed, when the flow of data is decided based on some parameters. As MMT network is bidirectional, in some part of communication it is using a specific orientation for communication while in some parts it may be reverse, based on the algorithm used to decide the communication. As an example consider algorithm 1 in which the communication is performed from greater processor index to lesser processor index, so the direction is different from algorithm 2 in which the root processor transfers data to other processors of respective rows. References [1] R.

      "1. Introduction Denote by Ug,n the moduli space of reduced but otherwise arbitrarily singular, connected, proper curves of genus g with n marked points. It is known to be representable by an algebraic stack, locally of finite type over Spec Z with quasicompact and finite diagonal [Smy13, Appendix B]. We will call this the moduli space of all curves. The moduli space of all curves is not particularly \"nice:\" it is known to possess many irreducible components, due to existence of non-smoothable curve singularities of various genera [Mum75, Pin74]. It is also known to be highly non-separated, as evidenced by the many alternate compactifications of the moduli space of smooth pointed curves Mg,n [FS10, Bat22, BB22, BKN23]. However, in this article we show that it has at least one nice geometric property: it is connected. Theorem 1.1. Ug,n is connected and the fibers of Ug,n → Spec Z are geometrically connected for all g, n ≥ 0. Our method is to construct a path in the moduli space of all curves from any curve to a curve with only smoothable singularities. We use in an essential way Ishii's theory of territories [Ish80] and its further development in [BGS24]. Ishii's underappreciated theorem [Ish80, Corollary 2] on connectedness of territories of local rings plays an especially important role. 2. Background Fix an algebraically closed field k for the remainder of the paper. Suppose B is the complete local ring of a reduced algebraic curve singularity, that is, B is a complete, reduced, local k-algebra of Krull dimension 1. Let A be the integral closure of B. Then we may identify A with Qm i=1 kJtiK, where m is the number of branches of the singularity. The conductor CondA/B of A over B is the largest ideal of A that is also an ideal of B. The conductor may be written CondA/B = (t c , . . . , tcm m ) for some vector of positive integers ~c = (c1, . . . , cn), called the conductances or branch conductances of the singularity. Their sum c we call the total conductance of the singularity. Let ∆ be the B-module A/B. It is a finite-dimensional k-vector space whose dimension δ we call the delta invariant of the singularity. Date: June 2024. 12 SEBASTIAN BOZLEE Modding out by the conductor, we obtain a subalgebra B := B/CondA/B of A~c,k := Ym k= k[ti]/(t ci i ) ∼= A/CondA/B such that A~c,k/B ∼= ∆ as B-modules. Thus for any curve singularity over k there is an associated subalgebra B of the finite k-algebra A~c,k of codimension δ. This subalgebra only depends on the choice of identification of A with Qm i=1 kJtiK. Since B is a local ring, we notice that B factors through the subalgebra A + ~c,k = {(fi(ti))i=1,...,m ∈ A~c,k | fi(0) = fj (0) for all i, j} of A~c,k where all \"constants\" are equal. (More geometrically, if ν : Ce → C is the normalization of a reduced curve, then a function on Ce can only descend to C if it is constant on the fibers of ν : Ce → C.) The codimension g of B in A + ~c,k is called the genus of the singularity, and it is equal to δ − (m − 1). Conversely, given a k-subalgebra B of A~c,k, we can form a subalgebra B′ = π − (B) of Qm i=1 kJtiK, where π : Qm i=1 kJtiK → A~c,k is the quotient map. Provided B factors through A + ~c,k, B′ will be a complete local reduced 1-dimensional k-algebra. Moreover, we have CondA/B′ ⊇ (t c , . . . , tcn n ). If B came from a ring B as in the paragraphs above, then this process recovers B up to isomorphism: B′ ∼= B. Therefore, to parametrize reduced curve singularities, it suffices to parametrize the subalgebras of fixed codimension in the following finite algebras. Definition 2.1. Let ~c = (c1, . . . , cm) be a tuple of positive integers. Let A~c = Ym i= Z[ti]/(t ci i ) and A + ~c = {(f1(t1), . . . , fm(tm)) ∈ A~c | fi(0) = fj (0) for all i, j}. We note A~c,k = A~c ⊗ k and A + ~c,k = A + ~c ⊗ k. The subalgebras of such algebras are parametrized by moduli schemes called territories, originally introduced by Ishii for k-algebras in the context of Noetherian k-schemes. We start by defining an appropriate moduli functor. Definition 2.2. (See [Ish80, Definition 1], [BGS24, Section 2]) Let S be a scheme and A a finite locally free sheaf of OS-algebras of rank n. Given an S-scheme f : T → S, a family of subalgebras of A of corank δ on T is a quasi-coherent OT -subalgebra B of f ∗A such that the quotient OT -module f ∗A /B is locally free of rank δ. We define a functor F δ A : (Sch/S) op → Set by: (i) If f : T → S is an S-scheme, F δ A (T → S) is the set of families of subalgebras of A of corank δ on T. (ii) If g : T → T ′ is a morphism of S-schemes, then F δ A (g) : F δ A (T ′ ) → F δ A (T) is defined by taking a family of subalgebras to its pullback.CONNECTEDNESS OF THE MODULI SPACE OF ALL REDUCED ALGEBRAIC CURVES Lemma 2.3. (See [Ish80, Theorem 1], [BGS24, Theorem 2.5]) Let S be a scheme and A a finite locally free sheaf of OS-algebras of rank n. The functor F δ A is represented by a closed S-subscheme Terδ A of Gr(n − δ, A ). In particular TerδA is locally projective over S. The reasoning at the beginning of this section implies that each isomorphism class of curve singularity over k is represented by a k-point of Terg A + ~c , where g is the genus of the singularity and ~c = (c1, . . . , cm) is its vector of branch conductances. The global analogue of the territory is defined as follows. We will apply this in the case that Xe is a family of smooth, possibly disconnected curves; then X will vary over the curves with normalization Xe such that the vanishing of the conductor CondX/X e is contained in Z. Definition 2.4. Suppose that πe : Xe → S is a locally quasiprojective family of schemes. Let ι : Z → Xe be a closed subscheme such that πe ◦ ι : Z → S is finite locally free of fixed rank. Write IZ/Xe for the sheaf of ideals of Z in Xe. Define a functor F δ Z/X/S e that assigns to an S-scheme T the set of diagrams XeT X T ν πeT π such that (i) ν is an affine morphism of schemes, (ii) the associated map of sheaves ν ♯ : OX → ν∗OX is injective, (iii) ν ♯ (OX) contains ν∗IZT /XT, (iv) letting ∆ = ν∗OXeT/ν♯(OX), the OT -module π∗∆ is locally free of rank δ. Restriction morphisms F δ Z/X/S e (T ′ ) → F δ Z/X/S e (T) are given by pullback. If Xe is a family of smooth, possibly disconnected, proper curves, and X is a family of connected curves, we call the family ν : Xe → X a family of equinormalized curves over T. Moduli of equinormalized curves are studied in more detail in [BGS24]. Although the data might seem more weighty, moduli of such diagrams are also parametrized by the territory of a finite locally free sheaf of algebras. Lemma 2.5. [BGS24, Theorem 4.3] With notation as above, the functor F δ Z/X/S e is representable by the scheme Terδ πe∗OZ which we also denote by Terδ Z/X/S e . The isomorphism of functors F δ Z/X/S e → Terδ πe∗OZ is given by sending a family XeT → X to π∗(ν ♯ (OX)/ν∗IZT /XT). In particular, if Ce is a smooth, possibly disconnected curve over k and Z is a closed subscheme consisting of points q1, . . . , qm with respective multiplicities c1, . . . , cm, then Terδ Z/C/e Spec k ∼= Terδ A~c,k . Therefore we can view Terδ A~c,k as parametrizing families of curves normalized by Ce with conductor locus contained in Z. Crucially for our main result, Ishii has shown that the territories Ter g A + ~c,k are connected.4 SEBASTIAN BOZLEE Definition 2.6. A chain of A k s is a nodal curve with irreducible components S1, . . . , Sr such that Si ∼= A k for all i, and for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r, #(Si ∩ Sj ) = ( 1 if j = i + i 0 else. Lemma 2.7. For any g and ~c, Terg A + ~c → Spec Z has geometrically connected fibers. More specifically, any two k-points of Terg A + ~c ,k are connected by an embedded chain of A k s. Proof. This follows from [Ish80, Corollary 2] and the fact that territories base change as expected: Terg A ×S T ∼= TergA ⊗SOT . By contrast, Terδ A~c is rarely connected. It has connected components corresponding to different choices of points to glue together, see below. Lemma 2.8. For any δ,~c, Terδ A~c is a disjoint union of products of territories of A + ~c . More precisely, Terδ A~c ∼= G P,g Y P ∈P Terg(P) A + ~c|P where the disjoint union varies over the partitions P of {1, . . . , m} together with functions g : P → N such that P P ∈P g(P) = δ − (m − 1). Proof. This follows from an identical proof to [BGS24, Theorem 3.8], after dropping the constraint of having the \"correct\" conductances. Tracing through the equivalences shows that if Ce is a smooth curve and Z is a closed subscheme consisting of points q1, . . . , qm with respective multiplicities c1, . . . , cm, then the summand of Terδ Z/C/e Spec k ∼= Terδ A~c,k indexed by (P, g) parametrizes the normalized curves ν : Ce → C obtained by gluing together, for each part P of P, the points qi whose indices lie in P to the curve singularity indicated by the Terg(P) A + ~c|P -coordinate. 3. Constructing the path Definition 3.1. Let n1, . . . , nm positive integers. Let Xn1,...,nm denote the singularity Spec k⊕ t n 1 kJt1K ⊕ · · · ⊕ t nm m kJtmK. The singularities Xn1,...,nm are known variously as universal singularities or partition singularities.[Ste93] We remark that Xn1,...,nm has m branches, branch conductances n1,. . ., nm, genus n1+· · ·+nm −m, and delta invariant n1+· · ·+nm −1. We also remark that Xn1,...,nm is the transverse union of the unibranch singularities Xni = Spec k[t i : i ≥ ni] for i = 1, . . . , m. Lemma 3.2. For any n1, . . . , nm, the singularity Xn1,...,nm is smoothable. Proof. It suffices to show that Xn1,...,nm is a limit of smoothable singularities. Let R = k[xi,j : i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , ni] and consider the subring B = R · 1 ⊕ Mm i= h(ti − xi,1)· · ·(ti − xni)i of A = Ym i= R[ti], where h(ti−xi,1)· · ·(ti−xi,ni)i denotes the ideal generated by (ti−xi,1)· · ·(ti−xi,ni) in R[ti]. The quotient A/B is a finite free R-module of rank n1 + · · · + nm − 1. (A basis is given byCONNECTEDNESS OF THE MODULI SPACE OF ALL REDUCED ALGEBRAIC CURVES the images of xi, . . . , x ni− i and (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . ,(0, . . . , 0, 1, 0).) It follows Spec B → Spec R is a flat family of affine curves. The generic fiber of Spec B → Spec R has one singularity obtained by gluing the points ti = xi,j to a single point transversally. This is an ordinary n1 + · · · + nm-fold point (i.e., the same singularity as that formed by the coordinate axes in A n1+···+nm.) Ordinary n1 + · · · + nm-fold points are smoothable singularities. It follows that the singularity Xn1,...,nm, which appears in the fiber over the point where all xi,j = 0, is a limit of smoothable singularities. Therefore it too is smoothable. Corollary 3.3. Each non-empty Terg A + ~c has a k-point corresponding to a smoothable singularity. Proof. In order that Terg A + ~c be non-empty, it is necessary that δ + 1 ≤ c.[AK70, Chapter VIII, Proposition 1.16] Suppose g as a non-negative integer and ~c = (c1, . . . , cm) is a vector of positive integers with sum c such that δ + 1 = g + m ≤ c. It follows g ≤ Pm i=1(ci − 1). As the latter is a sum of non-negative integers, we can find integers n1, . . . , nm with 1 ≤ ni ≤ ci for all i such that g = Pm i=1(ni − 1). Then Xn1,...,nm is a smoothable, m-branch singularity with genus g, and its ring of regular functions k ⊕ t n 1 kJt1K ⊕ · · · ⊕ t nm m kJtmK contains the ideal (t c , . . . , tcm m ). Quotienting by this ideal yields a subalgebra of A + ~c,k corresponding to Xn1,...,nm. This is the required point of Terg A + ~c . We now prove Theorem 1.1. Proof. Let (C, p1, . . . , pn) ∈ Ug,n(k) be an arbitrary reduced, connected, proper curve over k. Let ν : Ce → C be the normalization of C, and let pe1, . . . , pen ∈ Ce be lifts of p1, . . . , pn. Let Z = V (CondC/C e ) ⊆ Ce be the vanishing of the conductor ideal, and let q1, . . . , qm be the points of its support with respective multiplicities c1, . . . , cm. Observe that OZ ∼= A + ~c,k. Consider T = Terδ Z/C/e Spec k ∼= Terδ A~c,k . By Lemma 2.8, the point x = (ν : Ce → C, pe1, . . . , pen) of T factors through an open and closed subscheme of T isomorphic to Q P ∈P Terg(P) A + ~c|P ,k for some partition P of {1, . . . , m} and function g : P → N. We know by Lemma 2.7 that this space is connected by embedded chains of A k s. In particular, using Corollary 3.3, and interpreting the chain of A k 's as parametrizing families of equinormalized curves, there is a family of equinormalized curves over a chain of A k s connecting x to an equinormalized curve (ν ′ : Ce′ → C ′ , pe ′ , . . . , pe ′ n ) with only smoothable singularities. Forgetting the normalization results in a family of curves in Ug,n connecting (C, p1, . . . , pn) to a curve (C ′ , p′ , . . . , p′ n ) in the closure of Mg,n. As Mg,n is connected with geometrically connected fibers over Spec Z, Theorem 1.1 follows.

      "1 Introduction The Segre cubic is a classical three-dimensional variety with many interesting properties. For example, it is a compactification of the moduli space of configurations of six points on the projective line (see [6, §2]) and its dual variety, called the Igusa quartic, is a compactification of the moduli space of certain abelian surfaces (see [13, Theorem 2]). Birational geometry of the Segre cubic was extensively studied, for example, its small resolutions were described (see [8]). The aim of this article to study equivariant birational rigidity of forms of the Segre cubic. Equivariant birational rigidity of the Segre cubic itself over algebraically closed field of characteristic zero was studied by the author in the paper [1]. We show that for every field of characteristic zero there is only one form of the Segre cubic over this field which is G-birationally rigid (see Definition 3.2), and only for the following groups: S6, A6, S5 and A5, where S6 is the full automorphism group and groups S5 and A5 are embedded into S6 in the standard way (see Definition 2.3). Moreover, in these cases the form of the Segre cubic is G-birationally superrigid. These results can be useful, for example, for classification of finite subgroups of three-dimensional Cremona groups over fields of characteristic zero. We wxpect that these results are valid also over fields of characteristic p > 5. Also we prove that all forms of the Segre cubic have a point defined over the basic field, and all of them are cubic hypersurfaces. Special attention is given to the case of the field of real numbers. In this article we use the following notation for groups: by Cn we denote the cyclic group of order n; by D2n we denote the dihedral group of order 2n; by Sn we denote the symmetric group of rank n; by An we denote the alternating group of rank n. For an arbitrary field K by Ksep we denote its separable closure. This work is supported by the Russian Science Foundation under grant No 1811-00121.

Trepalin for useful discussions and comments. 12 Biregular geometry of the forms of the Segre cubic Definition 2.1. The Segre cubic over the field K of characteristic zero or p > is a three-dimensional variety SK, which can be explicitely given by the following system of equations in P K : X i= xi = X i= x i = 0. (2.1.1) Usually, if it doesn't lead to misunderstanding, we will omit the index and denote the Segre cubic by S. We will call a variety X defined over an arbitrary field K of characteristic zero or p > 5 a form of the Segre cubic if XKsep = X ⊗K Spec Ksep is isomorphic to the Segre cubic over the field Ksep. If the field K is the field of real numbers R, we will call the variety X a real form of the Segre cubic. Remark 2.2. Note that equations (2.1.1) make sence over an arbitrary field, so there is at least one form of the Segre cubic over an arbitrary field. We will use the following well-known facts about the Segre cubic (see, for example, [6, §2]): • the automorphism group Aut(S) is isomorphic to S6 and acts by permutations of standard coordinates; • the singular set of the Segre cubic S consists of 10 ordinary double points, all of them form an Aut(S)-orbit and one of them has coordinates (1 : 1 : 1 : −1 : −1 : −1); • the variety S contains exactly 15 planes which form an Aut(S)-orbit, one of them can be given by equations x1 + x2 = x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 = 0 in standard coordinates; • every singular point of S lies on 6 planes and every plane on S contains exactly 4 singular points. In other words, singular points and planes form a (106, 154)-configuration in notation of [7]. The automorphism group of such a configuration is isomorphic to S6 and is induced by the automorphism group Aut(S) (see, for example, [2, Lemma 2.1]). Definition 2.3. We will say that a subgroup A5 ⊂ Aut(S) or S5 ⊂ Aut(S) is standard if it preserves some hyperplane {xi = 0}. In the sequel we will need the following easy facts about elements of order 2 and certain subgroups of the group S6. Lemma 2.4. The element (1 2) acting on the (106, 154)-configuration has exactly 4 fixed singular points and 3 invariant planes and its centralizer is isomorphic to C2×S4. The element (1 2)(3 4) acting on the (106, 154)-configuration has exactly 2 fixed singular points and 3 invariant planes and its centralizer is isomorphic to C2 × (C 2 ⋊ C2) ≃ C2 × D8. The element (1 2)(3 4)(5 6) acting on the (106, 154)- configuration has exactly 4 fixed singular points and 7 invariant planes and its centralizer is isomorphic to C 2 ⋊S3. The stabilizer of a singular point is isomorphic to S 3 ⋊ C2, the stabilizer of a plane is isomorphic to S4 × C2. A non-standard subgroup S5 acts on the set of planes with two orbits of length 5 and 10 respectively. 2Proof. Simple direct computations. Corollary 2.5. Every real form of the Segre cubic has a singular point defined over the base field R. Proof. Let X be a real form of the Segre cubic. Consider an action of the complex conjugation σ on the (106, 154)-configuration of singular points and planes on the Segre cubic XC. Since σ acts as an element of order 2 or 1, by Lemma 2.4 we have a σ-invariant singular point. For an arbitrary field K we have the following assertion. Lemma 2.6. A form X of the Segre cubic over the field K contains a K-point if and only if the variety X is isomorphic to a cubic hypersurface in P K . Proof. Assume that the variety X has a point defined over the field K. Then the group Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/K) coincides with its subgroup Pic(X) (see, for example, [14, Theorem 9.1]). In particular, the divisor class − 2KX is defined over K and its linear system induces an embedding of X into P K as a cubic hypersurface. Due to [4, Proposition 3.2] the converse statement is also true. As a consequence, every real form of the Segre cubic is a cubic itself. Let us show, that analogous result is valid over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero or p > 5. For this purpose we need the following lemma. Lemma 2.7. (cf. [4, Lemma 2.3]) Let K be an arbitrary field of characteristic different from 2, and let L/K be a composite of quadratic extensions of the field K. Let X be a variety over the field K such that XL is isomorphic to a cubic in P L . Suppose that XL has an L-point. Then X has a K-point. Proof. There is a sequence of quadratic field extensions K = L0 ⊂ L1 ⊂ L2 ⊂ ... ⊂ Ln = L. By the induction it is enough to consider the case when L is a quadratic extension of K. Since the characteristic of K differs from 2, the extension K ⊂ L is a Galois extension. We know that the cubic XL contains an L-point. This point is either defined over K or its Gal(L/K)-orbit consists of two points. In the second case the line l passing through these points is defined over K. If this line lies on XL then X contains every K-point of the line l. If the line l doesn't lie on XL then the third intersection point of the line l and the cubic XL is defined over K. Lemma 2.8. Let K be a field of characteristic zero or p > 5. Then every form of the Segre cubic over the field K has a K-point and isomorphic to a cubic hypersurface. Proof. Let X be a form of the Segre cubic. There is the exact sequence 0 → Pic(X) → Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/K) → Br(K), see, for example, [9, Problem 3.3.5(iii)]. If the divisor class − 2KX is not defined over the field K, then the group Pic(X) is embedded into Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/K) as a subgroup of index 2, so we define canonically an element of order 2 in the Brauer group Br(K). Since this element has a representation as a tensor product of 3quaternion algebras over the field K (see [12, Theorem 11.5]), there is a composite L of quadratic extensions of the field K such that our algebra splits over this extension. Thus the corresponding embedding Pic(XL) → Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/L) is an isomorphism. The linear system | − 2KXL | induces an embedding of XL into P L as a cubic hypersurface. By Lemma 2.6 there is an L-point on XL. By Lemma 2.7 there is a K-point on X. In particular, by Lemma 2.6, the variety X is isomorphic to a cubic hypersurface in P K . Now we return to the field of real numbers. Proposition 2.9. There are exactly 4 real forms of the Segre cubic S up to isomorphism. All of them are three-dimensional cubic hypersurfaces and rational over the field R. Proof. It is well-known (see, for example, [15, Chapter III, §1]) that there is a oneto-one correspondence between the forms of a real variety X and the elements of H (Gal(C/R), Aut(XC)). The latter set, in turn, is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all homomorphisms Gal(C/R) ≃ C2 → S6 ≃ Aut(XC) up to conjugation. Such homomorphisms are defined by conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 or 1 in the group S6. There are exactly four such classes: the trivial permutation and conjugacy classes of the transposition (1 2), the product of two transpositions (1 2)(3 4) and the product of three transpositions (1 2)(3 4)(5 6). Let X be a real form of the Segre cubic S. By Corollary 2.5 the variety X contains an R-point. By Lemma 2.6 the variety X is isomorphic to a cubic in P R . This cubic contains a singular point defined over the field R and the projection from such a point gives us a birational map from the variety X to P R . We say that a real form X of the Segre cubic is of type I (resp., II, III or IV) if the image of the complex conjugation in the group Aut(S) ≃ S6 is the trivial permutation (resp., is conjugate to the transposition (1 2), is conjugate to the permutation (1 2)(3 4) or is conjugate to the permutation (1 2)(3 4)(5 6)). Remark 2.10. The form of the Segre cubic of type I can be obtained in the following way: blow up five R-points of P R in general position and contract proper transforms of lines passing through pairs of points. The obtained variety is the required form of the Segre cubic. It also can be defined explicitely by the equations (2.1.1). Note that in this case there is an action of the group S5 on P 3 with five marked points and the construction is S5-equivariant. The forms of type IV and III can be constructed in a similar way, but we need to blow up P R in 3 real points and one pair of conjugated points or one real point and two pairs of conjugated points in general position respectively. One can easily see that we obtain exactly forms of type IV and III by calculation of numbers of singular Rpoints and planes defined over R in both cases. The form of type II has no such a transformation into P R , but by Proposition 2.9 a transformation of other type exists. In the following proposition we describe automorphism groups of all forms of the Segre cubic. 4Proposition 2.11. The automorphism group of a form of the Segre cubic over an arbitrary field K of characteristic zero or p > 5 coincides with the centralizer of the image of the Galois group Gal(Ksep/K) in the automorphism group of the (106, 154)-configuration of singular points and planes on S. The automorphism group of the form of the Segre cubic of type I (resp., II, III or IV) is isomorphic to S6 (resp., C2 × S4, C2 × D8 or C 2 ⋊ S3). Proof. Let X be a form of the Segre cubic over K. There is a canonical embedding of the automorphism group of X into the automorphism group of the (106, 154)- configuration of singular points and planes on XKsep ≃ S and the canonical map from the Galois group Gal(Ksep/K) into the same group S6. Since all automorphisms defined over the base field commute with the action of the Galois group, the image of such embedding is contained in the centralizer of the image of the Galois group Gal(Ksep/K). Let g ∈ S6 be an element of the automorphism group of the (106, 154)-configuration which commutes with the image of some element σ ∈ Gal(Ksep/K). Let eg be the corresponding automorphism of the variety XKsep . Then ge −1 ◦ σ−1 ◦ ge ◦ σ is a linear transformation of P Ksep which fixes all singular points of the variety XKsep . Since there are 10 singular points and they are in general enough position this linear map is trivial. Thus σ −1 ◦ ge ◦ σ = ge. If g commutes with all elements of the image of Gal(Ksep/K) then eg is defined over the base field K. As a consequence, the embedding of the group Aut(X) into the centralizer of the image of the Galois group is an isomorphism. The second assertion is a consequense of Lemma 2.4. 3 Birational geometry of the forms of the Segre cubic For the classification of finite subgroups in Cremona groups it is important to study G-birational rigidity of Fano varieties. Definition 3.1. Let X and Y be a varieties with an action of a finite group G. We call a rational map f : X 99K Y a G-equivariant map if there exist an automorphism τ of the group G such that the following diagram commutes for every g ∈ G: X f ❴❴❴ / g Y τ(g) X f ❴❴❴ /Y We denote the group of G-equivariant automorphisms of a G-variety X by AutG(X) and the group of G-equivariant birational selfmaps of a G-variety X by BirG(X). Definition 3.2. Let G be a finite subgroup of the automorphism group of a Fano variety X with terminal singularities, and suppose that X is a GQ-factorial variety and rk Pic(X) G = 1. The variety X is called G-birationally rigid if there is no birational map from X to another G-Mori fibration. If one also has BirG(X) = AutG(X) then X is called G-birationally superrigid. There is the following theorem: 5Theorem 3.3. (see [1, Proposition 4.1, Theorem 4.8]) Let G ⊂ Aut(S) be a subgroup of the automorphism group of the Segre cubic over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Then the variety S is G-birationally rigid if and only if G containts a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ Aut(S). Moreover, in this case S is G-birationally superrigid. The next theorem is an analog of the previous statement over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. Theorem 3.4. Let X be a form of the Segre cubic over some field K of characteristic zero, and let G ⊂ Aut(X) be a subgroup. Assume that rk Pic(X) G = 1 and that the variety X is GQ-factorial and G-birationally rigid. Then the variety X can be explicitely given by equations (2.1.1) and G contains a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6. Conversely, the variety given by the equations (2.1.1) is A5-birationally superrigid with respect to a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ Aut(X). Proof. As were noticed earlier, there is a canonical embedding G ⊂ S6 where S is the automorphism group of the (106, 154)-configuration. Denote by H ⊂ S6 the image of the Galois group Gal(K/K) in S6. By Proposition 2.11 the group G is contained in the centralizer of the group H. Let F ⊂ S6 be a subgroup generated by G and H. If F does not contain a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6 then it is not hard to check directly with computer that the group F lies in one of the following subgroups: non-standard subgroup S5 ⊂ S6, S 3 ⋊ C2 (which is the stabilizer of a point), S4 × C2 (which is the stabilizer of a plane on S) or S4 × C2 (which is conjugate to the following group: S4 acts by permutations of coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4 while C permutes x5 and x6 in standard coordinates). Consider an action of a non-standard subgroup S5 ⊂ S6 on the set of planes on S. By Lemma 2.4 it has two orbits of length 5 and 10 respectively. The sum of all planes in the first orbit is not a QCartier divisor since the group Pic(X) is a primitive sublattice in the group Cl(X) and is generated by the class of hyperplane section while the sum of 5 planes is not a integer multiple of a hyperplane section in Cl(X). Thus in this case the G-variety is not GQ-factorial. In the second case the projection from a singular point which is invariant with respect to F gives us an equivariant birational map to P K . In the third case an F-invariant plane is a Weil divisor which is not Q-Cartier by the same reason as in the first case. But this is impossible since we assume that the variety X is GQ-factorial. Let us consider the forth case. Let the group S4×C2 act on P K as was described above. Then there is an S4 × C2-orbit that consists of the following planes on S: x1 + x2 = x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 = 0, x1 + x3 = x2 + x4 = x5 + x6 = 0, x1 + x4 = x2 + x3 = x5 + x6 = 0. They form a hyperplane section of S given by the equation x5 + x6 = 0. The only common point of these three planes p = (0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : −1) is defined over K and is G-invariant. Since the action of the group G on the hyperplane is a projectivisation of a four-dimensional representation of the group G and the invariant point p correspondes to a one-dimensional subrepresentation, we can find a three-dimensional subrepresentation of G as well. The corresponding G-invariant plane is defined over the base field. The projection from such a plane gives us a 6structure of G-equivariant cubic fibration. Now we can apply a G-equivariant resolution of singularities and relative G-equivariant minimal model program and obtain a G-birational transformation into a G-Mori fibration with the base of positive dimension. So the group F contains a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6, hence it is isomorphic to one one the following groups: A5, S5, A6 or S6. The groups G and H are normal subgroups of F, all elements of G commute with all elements of H and they generate the whole group F. Obviously, it is possible only in the following case: one of the groups G and F coincides with F while the other one is trivial. If the group G is trivial then the projection from any plane in P 4 which is defined over the base field gives us a structure of fibration by cubic surfaces. If the group H is trivial then the variety X can be given by the equations (2.1.1) and the group G contains a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6. Conversely, assume that the form X of the Segre cubic is given by the equations (2.1.1) and the group G contains a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6 ≃ Aut(X). Then by [1, Lemma 4.6, Lemma 4.7] the pair (X, µM) is canonical for every µ and every movable G-invariant linear subsystem M ⊂ | − µKX|. Hence by the Noether–Fano inequalities (see, for example, [5, Theorem 2.4] and [3, Theorem 3.2.6] in a G-equivariant situation) the variety X is G-birationally superrigid. Corollary 3.5. Among all real forms of the Segre cubic only the form of type I can be G-birationally rigid and only if the group G contains a standard subgroup A5. In this case it is G-birationally superrigid. Remark 3.6. It looks like the analogous statement (at least in one direction) should be valid also for fields of characteristic p > 5. We have a minimal model program for threefolds over algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 5 (see [10]) and it should work also in relative situation with a group action over arbitrary perfect field, but it is not known to the author if it is written down -nywhere. To prove the converse statement we need an analog of the Noether–Fano inequalities in positive characteristic and the existence of such analog is also unknown to the author. Remark 3.7. It is still an open question: does the birational (super)rigidity of the variety Xk = X ⊗Spec k Spec k over the field k implies the birational (super)rigidity of the variety X over the field k and is the same assertion true for varieties with the group action (see discussion in [11] and especially [11, Question 4]). Such a result is valid for algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero and its algebraically closed extension K, see [11, Theorem 2, Theorem 6]. References [1] A.

      "1. Introduction Let k be a field with separable closure ks. A natural invariant of a finite group G is the minimal dimension of a faithful representation of G over k, known as the representation dimension rdimk (G) of G over k. In [KM08, Thm. 4.1], Karpenko and Merkurjev showed that rdimk (G) is equal to the essential dimension edk (G) when G is a finite p-group over a field k containing a p-th root of unity. Since then, much work has been done on the representation dimensions of finite p-groups, such as [MR10], [CKR11], and [BMKS16]. For finite groups more broadly, representation dimension is an upper bound on essential dimension, although the two do not coincide in general. It is natural to study bounds on the complexity of groups via bounds on their representation dimensions. In [CKR11], Cernele, Kamgarpour, and Reichstein proved upper bounds in terms of p and n on the representation dimensions over the complex numbers C of groups of order p n for prime p. Similarly, Moret´o showed that the representation dimension over C of any finite group G, except for certain 2-groups, is at most p |G| [Mor21]. While the works in the previous paragraph focused on complex representations of groups, in the current work we investigate representations of algebraic tori over arbitrary fields. An (algebraic) torus over k is an algebraic group over k that, when viewed as an algebraic group over ks, is isomorphic to a finite product of copies of the multiplicative group. We say that an algebraic torus over k is irreducible if it does not properly contain a subtorus over k. Every algebraic torus T admits a matrix representation 12 B. HEATH via an embedding T ֒→ GLn for some positive integer n, and the representation dimension rdim (T) is the minimal n for which there exists a faithful embedding T ֒→ GLn. A result analogous to that of [KM08, Thm. 4.1] for essential p-dimensions of tori over arbitrary fields was proved in [LMMR13], with minimal degrees of p-faithful representations of tori appearing in the result. Moreover, Merkurjev proved an explicit formula for the representation dimension of an algebraic torus over a field whose splitting group is a p-group [Mer17, Thm. 4.3]. A consequence of the Jordan-Zassenhaus Theorem below is the following: For any positive integer n, there exists a maximal representation dimension of all n-dimensional algebraic tori over all fields. In this paper, we study the following quantities, where each maximum is taken over all fields: rdim (n) := max {rdim (T) | T a torus, dim (T) = n} rdimirr (n) := max {rdim (T) | T an irreducible torus, dim (T) = n} . We now state the results of the present work. Theorem 1.1. In Table 1, we have lower bounds on rdim (n) for all positive integers n. Table 1. Lower bounds on rdim (n) for all positive integers n. n rdim (n) ≥ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ≥ 7 n Note that Theorem 1.1 only asserts the existence of some n-dimensional torus over some field with the claimed representation dimension, so the bounds are not guaranteed to hold over a given particular field. However, we show that these bounds hold over the following important class of fields. Corollary 1.2. The bounds on rdim (n) in Theorem 1.1 hold over any number field. We show that Table 1 gives exact values of rdimirr (n) in many cases. Theorem 1.3. The bounds in Table 1 give exact values of rdimirr (n) for the following values of n: (a) n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}. (b) primes n such that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo n is equal to n − 1 or n− .REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Item (b) in Theorem 1.3 addresses the specific cases a = 1, 2 of the following more general asymptotic bound; in particular, it says that we can take N1 = N2 = 1. Theorem 1.4. For all positive integers a, there exists a positive integer Na such that, for all primes p ≥ Na such that the multiplicative order of modulo p is equal to p− a , we have rdimirr (p) = 2p. Although a bound on Na in Theorem 1.4 can be extracted from the proof of Theorem 5.22, this is not enough to prove that Theorem 1.4 implies that rdimirr (p) = 2pfor infinitely many primes p. For example, this would follow from the existence of some positive integer a such that there exist infinitely primes p for which the order of 2 modulo p is equal to p− a , but no such a is known. In particular, Artin famously conjectured that there are infinitely many primes p such that 2 is a primitive root modulo p (i.e., the a = case) [HB86, §1], yet this remains an open problem. Nonetheless, based on the theorems above and computational evidence, we pose the following conjecture. Conjecture 1.5. The bounds in Table 1 give exact values of rdim (n) for all positive integers n.

Preliminaries The main tools that we use to study representation dimensions of algebraic tori are G-lattices and their symmetric ranks. This largely reduces to the study of actions of finite integral matrix groups on certain subgroups of the additive group Z n . Let us begin with the definition of a G-lattice. We write Z + for the set of positive integers. Definition 2.1. A lattice L is a free Z-module of finite rank n ∈ Z +. In this case, we say that the rank of L is rank (L) = n. If the group G acts on L (or, equivalently, if L is a module over the group ring Z [G]), then we further say that L is a G-lattice. Note that every G-lattice L can be written (up to isomorphism) with L = Z n and G a subgroup of GLn (Z), where n = rank (L). We will often think about G-lattices through this linear algebraic lens moving forward. We often focus on irreducible G-lattices in this paper.4 B. HEATH Definition 2.2. The G-lattice L is irreducible if the Q [G] module LQ := L ⊗Z Q is irreducible, i.e., if LQ has no nontrivial proper G-invariant submodules. Definition 2.3. The subgroup G ≤ GLn (Z) is said to be irreducible if the G-lattice Z n is irreducible. The G-lattices L and L ′ are said to be Z-equivalent if L ∼= L′ as Z [G]- modules, and L and L ′ are said to be Q-equivalent if LQ ∼= L ′ Q as Q [G]- modules. This distinction between isomorphism of G-lattices over Z and over Q is subtle, but important. We record the following useful observations about Q-equivalence of G-lattices. Proposition 2.4. [PP77a, §2] [Lor05, §1.2.1] Let G be a group and let L be a G-lattice of rank n. (a) If L ′ ⊆ L is a G-sublattice of rank n (or, equivalently, of finite index in L), then L and L ′ are Q-equivalent G-lattices. (b) Conversely, if LQ ∼= L ′ Q , then replacing L ′ with an isomorphic copy inside of LQ, we may assume that L ′ ⊆ L and that the quotient module L/L′is finite. The invariant of G-lattices that we use to study representation dimensions of algebraic tori is the symmetric rank. This notion was introduced by MacDonald in [Mac11], in which the author studied a related version of symmetric rank known as the symmetric p-rank in order to study essential p-dimensions of normalizers of maximal tori. Definition 2.5. The symmetric rank of a G-lattice L, denoted symrank (L, G), is the minimal size of a G-stable generating set of L. Lemma 2.6. Let n ∈ Z +, let G ≤ GLn (Z), and let L ⊆ Zn be a G-lattice. (a) We have the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ |G|rank (L). (b) If H ≤ GLn (Z) is conjugate over GLn (Z) to G, then there exists an H-lattice M ⊆ Z n such that M as an H-lattice is isomorphic to L as a G-lattice. In particular, symrank (M, H) = symrank (L, G). (c) If K ≤ G, then L is a K-lattice with symrank (L, K) ≤ symrank (L, G). Proof. For (a), let ℓ1, . . . , ℓrank(L) be a generating set for L as a lattice. Observe that the set S = Srank(L) i=1 Gℓi is a G-stable generating set for L, and |Gℓi| ≤ |G| for each 1 ≤ i ≤ rank (L). Thus, S is a G-stable generating set for L of size at most |G|rank (L). For (b), suppose G = AHA−1for A ∈ GLn (Z). The matrix A is a change of basis matrix from the standard basis for Z n to some other basis B for Z n , so take M to be the lattice L written in the basis B. For (c), it is clear that L is a K-lattice. The symmetric rank statement follows from the fact that the G-orbit of v ∈ L is equal to the union of the orbits of v under the actions of the cosets of K in G. REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Note that any two Z-equivalent G-lattices have the same symmetric rank by (b) of Lemma 2.6, but Q-equivalent G-lattices need not have equal symmetric ranks. Given an algebraic torus T, the character group XT of T is a G -lattice for the absolute Galois group G := Gal (ks/k) (see, e.g., [Wat79, §7.3]). Although G may be infinite, the following observation tells us that we can think of G as acting on XT via a finite group. Proposition 2.7. [Wat79, §7.3] Let T be an algebraic torus with character group XT . Then, the action of G on XT factors through the finite group Gal (k ′/k) for some finite Galois extension k ⊆ k′ . Recall that an action of G on a set X is said to be continuous if X is a union of G -orbits where each orbit factors through Gal (k ′/k) for some finite Galois extension k ⊆ k ′ . The following theorem now makes precise the close relationship between G-lattices and algebraic tori. Theorem 2.8. [Wat79, §7.3] The functor F, from the category of algebraic tori to the category of finitely generated free Abelian groups on which G acts continuously, defined by F (T) = XT is an antiequivalence of categories. In particular, in the correspondence of Theorem 2.8, irreducible tori correspond to irreducible G -lattices. We now state the connection between representation dimensions of algebraic tori and symmetric ranks of G-lattices. See [Hea24, §4.4] for a proof. Theorem 2.9. Let T be an algebraic torus over the field k, let XT be the character group of T, and let G be the absolute Galois group of k. Then, rdim (T) = symrank (XT , G ). A direct consequence of Theorem 2.9 and the fact that every finite group occurs (up to isomorphism) as the Galois group of some Galois field extension is the following. Corollary 2.10. For all n ∈ Z +, we have rdim (n) = max (symrank (L, G)), where the maximum is taken over all finite groups G and all G-lattices of rank n. Even more explicitly, we obtain the following. Corollary 2.11. For all n ∈ Z +, we have rdim (n) = max (symrank (Z n , G)), where the maximum is taken over one representative G from each Z-conjugacy class of maximal (with respect to inclusion) finite subgroups of GLn (Z). We similarly have the following for rdimirr (n).6 B. HEATH Proposition 2.12. For all n ∈ Z +, we have rdimirr (n) = max (symrank (Z n , G)), where the maximum is taken over one representative G from each GLn (Z)- conjugacy class of irreducible, maximal, finite subgroups of GLn (Z). This motivates the study of finite subgroups of GLn (Z). One of the most famous results on this subject is the following theorem. Theorem 2.13 (Jordan-Zassenhaus Theorem). [Rei70, Thm. 2.6] For all n ∈ Z +, there are a finite number of Z-conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of GLn (Z). An important consequence of the Jordan-Zassenhaus Theorem is that the quantities rdim (n) and rdimirr (n) are well-defined. 3. Root Systems and Weyl Groups Some of the most important examples of G-lattices come from root systems and their Weyl groups. In this section, we compute the symmetric ranks of all W-lattices when W is the Weyl group of an irreducible root system, yielding lower bounds on rdim (n). We will then show that these bounds are realized over any number field. Theorem 3.4, along with the overall ideas in this section, are very similar to work done by Lemire to obtain upper bounds on essential dimensions of certain linear algebraic groups [Lem04]. We will follow the notation and conventions of [Hum72, Ch. 3]. • Φ denotes an irreducible root system of rank n ∈ Z + in a Euclidean space E with inner product (·, ·). • W (Φ), or simply W, is the Weyl group of Φ. • Λr is the root lattice associated to Φ, with base {α1, . . . , αn}. • For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we write σi: E → E for the reflection fixing the hyperplane orthogonal to αi , i.e., the hyperplane {β ∈ E | (β, αi) = 0}. • Λ is the weight lattice associated to Φ, with base {λ1, . . . , λn} given as follows: For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we define λi ∈ E to be the unique vector satisfying 2(λi,αj ) (αj ,αj ) = δi,j for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n, where δi,j is the Kronecker delta. • We denote by Λ+i an intermediate lattice Λr ⊂ Λ +i ⊂ Λ, with both inclusions proper and Λ : Λ+i = i. In the case Φ = Dn with n ≥ 4 even, there are two intermediate lattices with index 2 in Λ, each containing λn−1 or λn but not both. We will denote these intermediate lattices by Λ+ i , with λi ∈ Λ + i for each i ∈ {n − 1, n}. Computing symmetric ranks of root lattices is quite straightforward. Proposition 3.1. [Mac11, §1] Let Φ be an irreducible root system with Weyl group W and root lattice Λr. Then, the symmetric rank symrank (Λr, W) is equal to the number of short roots in Φ.REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI The following standard facts help us compute symmetric ranks of other W-lattices. Proposition 3.2. [Hum72, §13.1] For all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, we have σi (λj ) = λj − δi,jαi. In particular, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the reflection σi fixes all of the λj 's except for λi. Lemma 3.3. For any v = Pn i=1 viλi ∈ Λ, the stabilizer of v in W is given by stabW (v) = hσi| vi = 0i ≤ W. Proof. By Proposition 3.2, we have hσi| vi = 0i ⊆ stabW (v). The reverse inclusion follows from [Car72, Lem. 1]. We now present the main result of this section. Theorem 3.4. Let Φ be an irreducible root system of rank n with base {α1, . . . , αn} and Weyl group W, let Λr be the root lattice, and let Λ be the weight lattice with basis {λ1, . . . , λn} as defined above. Then, we have the values in Table 2 for the symmetric ranks of all W-lattices for all choices of Φ and n. In particular, the orbit W v is a particular W-stable generating set of minimal size for the given v ∈ Λ. Proof. Let C be the Cartan matrix of Φ, as given in [Hum72, §11.4]. If det (C) = 1, then Λr = Λ and we are done by Proposition 3.1. Otherwise, we identify Λ with Z n by identifying each λi with the standard basis vector ei and proceed as follows. Using the Smith normal form, there exist P, Q ∈ GLn (Z) and an n × n integral diagonal matrix D such that P CQ = D. Note that the choices of P and Q are not canonical; our choices can be found in [Hea24, Appendix A]. As C is the change of basis matrix from the λi's to the αi's [Hum72, §13.1], we have v ∈ Λ is an element of Λr if and only if Cw = v for some w ∈ Z n . Since Q ∈ GLn (Z), this is equivalent to the existence of some u ∈ Z n such that CQu = P −1Du = v. This equation provides conditions (via a system of linear equations) for determining the smallest (with respect to inclusion) W-sublattice of Λ containing a given v ∈ Λ. For each choice of Φ and n, the matrix P −1D is given in Table 3. From there, it is a standard fact (see, e.g., [Hum72, Lemma 10.4.B]) that the W-orbit of any nonzero v ∈ Λ has full rank. Therefore, if L ⊆ Λ is the smallest W-sublattice of Λ containing v, then the lattice spanned by W v must be L. We then use Lemma 3.3 and information about the Weyl groups of root systems (see, e.g., [Hum72, §12.2]) to compute the sizes of these orbits. We now have the following immediate corollary of Theorem 3.4. Corollary 3.5. In Table 4, we have lower bounds on rdim (n) for all n ∈ Z +, along with a G-lattice realizing each bound.8 B.

Theorem 3.6. For any number field K and any n ∈ Z +, there exists an algebraic torus T over K of dimension n with rdim (T) equal to the bound given in Corollary 3.5. Proof. The key idea is the following result of [Nuz95]: For all irreducible root systems Φ except F4, there exists a regular Galois extension of the function field Q (t) (where t is an indeterminate) with Galois group isomorphic to the Weyl group W (Φ). As W (F4) does not occur in Table 4, we need notREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Table 3. The n × n matrices P −1D used in the proof of Theorem 3.4.

Now, let K be a number field and let W be the Weyl group of an irreducible root system besides F4. By [JLY02, Cor. 3.2.4], K is Hilbertian. Since W is realizable as a Galois group over Q (t) by the paragraph above, Proposition 3.3.6 of [JLY02] implies that W is realizable as a Galois group over K (t). Result 3.3.4 of [JLY02] now asserts that W occurs as a Galois group over K, completing the proof. 10 B. HEATH Table 4.

Irreducible G-Lattices of Rank n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23} Now, we compute rdimirr (n) for n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}. In particular, we will show that the lower bounds given in Corollary 3.5 are sharp by finding upper bounds on the symmetric ranks of all irreducible G-lattices in these dimensions. These dimensions are special because of Theorem 4.1 below. We use the common abbreviation i.m.f. for \"irreducible, maximal, finite.\" Theorem 4.1. [Vos65] [Tah71] [Dad65] [WBN71] [Ryˇs72] [PP77a] [PP77b] [PP80a] [PP80b] [PP80c] [Ple85] [Sou94] Explicit representatives of the Zconjugacy classes of i.m.f. subgroups of GLn (Z) are known for 1 ≤ n ≤ and n = 13, 17, 19, 23. Representatives from Theorem 4.1 are stored in the computer algebra system GAP [GAP22], along with other information about the groups. Each group is identified via an ordered triple (d, q, z), where d is the dimension, q is the numerical label of the GLn (Q)-class, and z is the numerical label of the GLn (Z)-class within the GLn (Q)-class. For more details, please see 50.7 of the online GAP manual. We have the following useful characterization of all i.m.f. subgroups of GLn (Z). Proposition 4.2. [PP77a, p. 536] For every i.m.f. subgroup G < GLn (Z), there exists a (not necessarily unique) positive definite n × n integral matrix X such that G is the full group of Z-automorphisms of X, i.e., G = AutZ (X) = M ∈ GLn (Z) | MT XM = X . Along with other data about the group, GAP stores such a matrix X for each i.m.f. subgroup. Definition 4.3. Given a positive definite n × n integral matrix X and a column vector v ∈ Z n , we call the integer v T Xv the norm of v under X.REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI The Θ-series of X is the power series ΘX (q) = P∞ i=0 Niq i with coefficients given by Ni:= v ∈ Z n | v T Xv = i . We now obtain a bound on symrank (Z n , G) in terms of the Θ-series coefficients. Lemma 4.4. Let G < GLn (Z) be an i.m.f. subgroup and suppose that G = AutZ (X) for the positive definite n × n integral matrix X. Write D = {Xi,i P | 1 ≤ i ≤ n} for the set of diagonal entries of X and ΘX (q) = ∞ i=0 Niq i for the Θ-series of X. Then, symrank (Z n , G) ≤ X i∈D Ni. Proof. Observe that the set v ∈ Z n | v T Xv ∈ D is G-stable and contains the standard basis vectors for Z n . Although the bound given in Lemma 4.4 is rather coarse in general, in most cases it is sufficient to prove the sharpness of the claimed bounds in dimensions 1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. Theorem 4.5. In Table 4.5, we have exact values of rdimirr (n), along with a G-lattice realizing each value. Table 5.

By Corollary 3.5, we need only to show that the values in Theorem 4.5 are upper bounds on rdimirr (n) for the given values of n. To do this, we use a computer algebra system to apply Lemma 4.4 to the representative from each GLn (Z)-conjugacy class of i.m.f. subgroups of GLn (Z) stored in GAP; see [Hea24, Appendix B] for our code and the output. We now address the groups for which Lemma 4.4 does not yield the claimed bound. The groups given by the following ordered triples are all isomorphic to C2×W (Dn), where C2 is the cyclic group of order 2: (d, 1, 3) for 5 ≤ d ≤ 10, (19, 1, 2), and (23, 2, 3). In each of these cases, by Theorem 3.4, we have symrank (Z n , G) ≤ 2 · n−1 = 2n .12 B. HEATH This leaves only the 23-dimensional group G given by the ordered triple (23, 3, 2) to consider. For this case, we first obtain that G = hM1, M2i for M1, M2 ∈ GL23 (Z). (See [Hea24, p. 62-63] for M1 and M2.) The minimal (nonzero) norm under the corresponding matrix X is 4, and there are vectors in Z 23 of norm 4 under X, one of which is the standard basis vector e2 ∈ Z 23. By computing the union of the orbits of e2 under the subgroups hM1i,hM2i, and hM1M2i, we see that the orbit Ge2 spans Z 23 as a lattice. As Ge2 is a subset of the set of elements of norm 4 under X, it follows that symrank Z 23, G ≤ 93150 < 23, as desired. Remark 4.6. For all dimensions 1 ≤ n ≤ 31, Q-class representatives of i.m.f. subgroups of GLn (Z) are known and stored in GAP. However, since Q-equivalent G-lattices can have different symmetric ranks, the techniques applied in this section cannot (at present) be directly applied to those dimensions not addressed in Theorem 4.5. 5. Irreducible G-Lattices of Prime Rank In this section and the next, we study irreducible G-lattices in prime dimensions to prove Theorem 1.4 and (b) of Theorem 1.3. Prime dimensions are especially nice because of the following fact. Proposition 5.1. [PP77a, §1] If ∆ : G → GLp (Z) is an irreducible representation of a finite group G of prime degree p, then ∆ is irreducible over Z if and only if ∆ is irreducible over C. In odd prime dimensions p, the following proposition classifies irreducible finite subgroups G < GLp (Z) by their maximal normal 2-subgroups. We first introduce the following notation for a finite subgroup G < GLn (Z): • G+ := G ∩ SLn (Z). • We denote by O2 (G) the maximal normal 2-subgroup of G. Proposition 5.2. [Ple85, Prop. II.2] Let p > 2 be a prime integer, let G < GLp (Z) be an irreducible finite group, and let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p. Then, one of the following occurs: (a) O2 (G+) is elementary abelian of order dℓ for some integer 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ p− d . In this case, G+ is conjugate under GLp (Q) to a group of integral monomial matrices (i.e., signed permutation matrices). Moreover, G+ contains an irreducible subgroup which is an extension of an elementary abelian 2-group of order d by a cyclic group of order p. (b) O2 (G+) = 1. In this case, G+ has a unique minimal normal subgroup N 6= 1 (possibly N = G+), and N is nonabelian simple, the centralizer CG+ (N) = 1, and N is irreducible as a matrix group. We will use Proposition 5.2 to consider two separate cases for irreducible finite subgroups of GLp (Z): Those satisfying (a), which we focus on in this section; and those satisfying (b), which we will address in Section 6.REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI We denote by Monn (Z) the group of all n × n monomial matrices and by Dn (Z) the subgroup of diagonal matrices. Note that Dn (Z) ∼= C n ; in particular, Monn (Z) ∼= Dn (Z) ⋊ Sn ∼= C n 2 ⋊ Sn, where C2 is the cyclic group of order 2 and Sn is the symmetric group on n letters. Unlike in those dimensions addressed in Chapter 4, in prime dimensions p ≥ 29 we have only a description of the GLp (Q)-conjugacy classes of irreducible, maximal, finite (i.m.f.) subgroups as opposed to the GLp (Z)- conjugacy classes. Thus, we use the following slightly different strategy in this section. Proposition 5.3. Let G < GLp (Z) be an irreducible finite group satisfying (a) of Proposition 5.2. Then, we have symrank (Z p , G) ≤ max H,L (symrank (L, H)), where the maximum is taken over all irreducible subgroups H ≤ Monp (Z) such that −Ip ∈ H and all H-lattices L ⊆ Z p . Proof. This follows from Proposition 2.4 and (a) of Proposition 5.2. Note that we may restrict our attention to those groups satisfying −Ip ∈ H because any group not satisfying this condition is certainly not a maximal subgroup of GLp (Z) up to Z-conjugacy. Observation 5.4. If −In ∈ G ≤ GLn (Z) for some odd n ∈ Z +, then: (a) G = −G. (b) |G| = 2 |G+|. (c) O2 (G) ∼= O2 (G+) × C2. Unless stated otherwise, throughout the remainder of this section, G ≤ Monn (Z) is an irreducible group satisfying the conditions that −In ∈ G, that |O2 (G+)| > 1, and that π (G) ≤ Sn contains an n-cycle (because of the final sentence in (a) of Proposition 5.2), where π : G → Sn is the projection map. We now classify the possibilities for O2 (G). First, we make an observation about 2-subgroups of Sn for odd n > 2. Lemma 5.5. If σ ∈ Sn is an n-cycle for n ≥ 3 odd, then the action of conjugation by σ on the set of 2-subgroups of Sn has no nontrivial fixed points. Proof. By [Cov00, Thm. 4.2.3], we have the following description of the Sylow-2 subgroups of Sn: Writing n in its base-2 representation n = Ps i=0 ai i (each ai ∈ {0, 1} and as = 1), the Sylow 2-subgroups of Sn are isomorphic to the direct products of the Sylow 2-subgroups of S i for 0 ≤ i ≤ s with ai = 1. Since n is odd, any nontrivial 2-subgroup S ≤ Sn therefore leaves fixed some 1 ≤ j ≤ n, but some element of σSσ−1 moves j since σ contains an n-cycle. Thus, σSσ−1 6= S. 14 B. HEATH Lemma 5.6. Let n > 2 be odd and let G ≤ Monn (Z) be a group of monomial matrices such that π (G) contains an n-cycle. Then, O2 (G) ≤ Dn (Z) (or, equivalently, O2 (G) = G ∩ Dn (Z)) and G ∼= O2 (G) ⋊ π (G). Proof. We prove that O2 (G) ≤ Dn (Z); the subsequent statement then follows. View G as a subgroup of Dn (Z) ⋊ Sn, and observe that π (O2 (G)) E π (G) is a normal 2-subgroup. Since π (G) contains an n-cycle, Lemma 5. implies that π (O2 (G)) must be trivial. We now have the following corollary of Lemma 5.6. Notationally, for a prime power q, we write Fq for the field with q elements. When q is prime, we take Fq to be the set {0, 1, . . . , q − 1} under the operations of addition and multiplication modulo q Corollary 5.7. Under the conditions of Lemma 5.6, O2 (G) must correspond to a π (G)-stable subspace of C p ∼= F p , where π (G) ≤ Sp acts by shuffling coordinates. For σ ∈ π (G), we will write Mσ for the permutation matrix in GLn (Z) corresponding to σ. At the level of matrices, the explicit action of π (G) on O2 (G) = G ∩ Dp (Z) is as follows: For D ∈ O2 (G), the permutation σ ∈ π (G) acts on D via D 7→ MσDM− σ . This has the effect of taking the (i, i) entry in D to position (σ (i), σ (i)). Corollary 5.7 motivates the study of subspaces of F p that are stable under certain subgroups of Sp. In particular, as the cyclic group Cp ≤ π (G) by assumption, the set of π (G)-stable subspaces of F p is a subset of the set of Cp-stable subspaces of F p . We will write k for the algebraic closure of the field k. Lemma 5.8. Let p > 2 be prime, let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p, let ζp ∈ F2 be a primitive pth root of unity, and let t1, . . . , t(p−1)/d ⊆ F × p be a transversal for the orbit of 2. Then, in the polynomial ring F2 [x], the polynomial x p − 1 factors into irreducibles as xp − 1 = Q(p−1)/d i=0 fi , where f0 (x) := x − 1 and fi (x) := Qd− j= x − ζ j ti p for all 1 ≤ i ≤ p− d . Proof. This follows from the standard fact that the Frobenius map y 7→ y generates any finite subgroup of the Galois group Gal F2/F (see, e.g., [DF04, §14.9]). Lemma 5.9. Let p > 2 be prime, let Cp act on F p by shuffling coordinates, and let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p. Then, there are p− d + 1 irreducible Cp-stable subspaces of F p , one corresponding to each of the irreducible factors of x p − 1 in the polynomial ring F2 [x]. Proof. Observe that Cp-stable subspaces of F p correspond to ideals in the quotient ring R := F2 [x] / (x p − 1). Lemma 5.8 and the Chinese RemainderREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Theorem give the following decomposition of R: (5.1) R ∼= (p M−1)/d i= F2 [x] / (fi) ∼= F2 ⊕ (p M−1)/d i= F d , where the fi are the irreducible polynomials defined in Lemma 5.8. We thus obtain a bijective correspondence between subsets of n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o and Cp-stable subspaces of F p . From here, we can explicitly construct the possibilities for O2 (G). Corollary 5.10. Let p > 2 be prime, let G < Monp (Z) be an irreducible group, and let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p. Write F2 = {0, 1} and x p−1 = Q(p−1)/d i=0 fi in F2 [x], with the fi's as defined in Lemma 5.8. For 0 ≤ i ≤ p− d , define gi:= Q j6=i fj ∈ F2 [x] and define the diagonal matrix Di ∈ Dp (Z) via Dij,j := ( 1 if the x j− coefficient of giis −1 if the x j− coefficient of giis 1. Then, for some S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o , we have O2 (G) = MσDiM− σ | σ ∈ π (G), i ∈ S ≤ Dp (Z), where Mσ ∈ GLp (Z) is the permutation matrix corresponding to the permutation σ ∈ π (G). Proof. By Corollary 5.7, O2 (G) must correspond to a π (G)-stable subspace of F p ; in particular, this subspace must be Cp-stable, so it must preserve the irreducible summands in (5.1). To identify a representative gifor the irreducible component F2 [x] / (fi), we seek a polynomial in F2 [x] satisfying gi ≡ 0 (mod fj ) for j 6= i and satisfying gi 6≡ 0 (mod fi). The gi given in the statement satisfies these conditions. In Table 6, we illustrate the ideas of Lemma 5.9 and Corollary 5.10 in four key cases. We define the all 1's column vector 1 · · · T =: 1. By abuse of notation, we will use the same notation whether viewing 1 as an element of F n or Z n , with the context making the meaning clear. Further, we write V1 := {1, 0} ⊆ F n and L1 ⊆ Z n for the G-lattice generated by 1 ∈ Z n . Definition 5.11. The support of a vector v = v1 · · · vn T in F n or Z n is the set supp (v) = i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} vi 6= . The support length of v is the quantity |supp (v)|.16 B. HEATH Table 6. Key examples of the correspondence between subsets of n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o , subspaces of F p , and representations of O2 (G) ≤ Dp (Z) described in Lemma 5.9 and Corollary 5.10. S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o Subspace of F p 2 O2 (G) ≤ Dp (Z) ∅ 0 {0} V1 = {1, 0} {±Ip} n 1, 2, . . . , p− d o VE := v ∈ F p |supp (v)| even Dp (Z) ∩ SLp (Z) n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o F p 2 Dp (Z) The following proposition gives a useful description of the subspaces in Table 6. We write An for the alternating group on n letters. Proposition 5.12. For all n ≥ 3, the only An-stable subspaces of F n are 0, F n , V1 = {1, 0}, and VE := v ∈ F n |supp (v)| even . These four subspaces are also the only Sn-stable subspaces of F n for all n ≥ 3. Proof. We first show that the four claimed subspaces are Sn-stable subspaces. It is clear that 0, V1, and F n are Sn-stable subspaces, and it is clear that the set VE is Sn-stable. That VE is a subspace of F n is a consequence of the following observation for v, w ∈ F n : |supp (v + w)| = |supp (v)| + |supp (w)| − 2 |supp (v) ∩ supp (w)| . Now, we show that these four subspaces are the only An-stable subspaces of F n ; it will then immediately follow that they are the only Sn-stable subspaces as well. We first observe that any An-stable subspace of F n containing one of the standard basis vectors must be all of F n and that any An-stable subspace containing a vector with support length 2 must contain VE. Further, since [F n : VE] = 2, it follows that VE is a maximal proper subspace of F n , so any subspace of F n containing VE must be VE or F n . Let v = v1 · · · vn T ∈ F n \\ {0, 1} and consider the An-subspace hAnvi ⊆ F n generated by v. If |supp (v)| ∈ {1, 2}, then hAnvi ∈ {F n , VE} by the previous paragraph and we are done. Similarly, if n = 3, then everyREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI vector in F n is either 0, 1, or has support length 1 or 2, and we are done by the previous paragraph. If n ≥ 4 and |supp (v)| ≥ 3, then there exist distinct 1 ≤ i, j, k, ℓ ≤ n such that vi = vj = vk = 1 and vℓ = 0. Let σ = (i, j) (k, ℓ) ∈ An and observe that |supp (v + σv)| = 2. It follows that hAnvi contains VE, so we are done. The following special class of integral vectors will be very important moving forward. Definition 5.13. We call a vector v ∈ Z n whose entries all belong to the set {0, 1} a binary vector of Z n . As the following result shows, binary vectors can be used to cook up nice generating sets for G-lattices when G is a group of monomial matrices containing all diagonal matrices in GLn (Z). We call a lattice L ⊆ Z n primitive if L 6= mM for any lattice M ⊆ Z n and integer m ≥ 2. Lemma 5.14. Let n ∈ Z +, let Dn (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monn (Z) such that π (G) ≤ Sn contains an n-cycle, and let L ⊆ Z n be a primitive G-lattice. (a) L is generated by binary vectors in Z n . (b) If L /∈ {0, L1} is a G-sublattice of Z n , then L contains a binary vector v ∈ Z n such that |supp (v)| ≤ 2n , where ⌊·⌋ is the floor function. Proof. The claim is trivially satisfied for n = 1, so we assume that n ≥ 2. To prove (a), it suffices to show that 2Z n ⊆ L. Since G contains a permutation matrix of degree n, this further reduces to showing that 2ei ∈ L for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where the ei's are the standard basis vectors for Z n . By the primitivity of L, there exists v = v1 · · · vn T ∈ L such that vj = 1 for some 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The diagonal matrix D with Djj = 1 and Dii = −1 for all i 6= j is an element of G, so v + Dv = 2ej ∈ L. Now, assume that L /∈ {0, L1} and that (b) does not hold. By (a), L contains distinct binary vectors v, w with support length at least 2n . Then, every entry of v + w is a 0, 1, or 2, with at least n of the entries being 2's. The 2's can be eliminated by subtracting 2ei, all of which are in L by the proof of (a), for appropriate choices of i, yielding a binary vector in L with support length at most 2n . Our next goal is to understand the primitive G-sublattices of Z p for groups G satisfying the conditions of Lemma 5.14. This turns out to be extremely similar to our above discussion of the possible representations of O2 (G). Corollary 5.15. Let p > 2 be prime, let Dp (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monp (Z) such that π (G) ≤ Sp contains a p-cycle, and let d be the multiplicative order of modulo p. Write F2 = {0, 1} and x p − 1 = Q(p−1)/d i=0 fi in F2 [x], with the fi's as defined in Lemma 5.8, and let g0, . . . , gn be as defined in Corollary 5.10. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, define the binary column vector vi ∈ Z p by defining vij to be the x j− coefficient of gi (viewing the entries of vi as elements of Z18 B. HEATH Table 7. Key examples of the correspondence between subsets of n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o and G-sublattices of Z p for finite groups Dp (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monp (Z) that contain a p-cycle. The vector 1 ∈ Z p is the all 1's vector, and L1 is the G-sublattice of Z p generated by the G-orbit of 1. See Table 6 or Proposition 5.12 for the definition of VE. S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o Subspace of F p 2 G-sublattice of Z p ∅ 0 {0} V1 = {1, 0} L n 1, 2, . . . , p− d o VE LE := [vi] ∈ Z p 2 | Pp i=1 vi n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o F p 2 Z p rather than of F2). Write Lifor the G-lattice generated by vi. Then, every primitive G-sublattice L ⊆ Z p has the form L = X i∈S Li for some S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o . Proof. This is analogous to Corollary 5.10, along with Lemma 5.14. In Table 7, we explicitly give the correspondence described in Corollary 5.15 in the same four cases as Table 6. Corollary 5.16. Suppose Dp (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monp (Z) satisfies the condition that π (G) ≤ Sp contains a p-cycle, and let L /∈ {0, L1} be a primitive Gsublattice of Z p . Then, L is generated as a G-lattice by the G-orbits of at most p− d binary vectors in Z p , each with support length at most j 2p k . Proof. If the subset S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o corresponding to L in Corollary 5.15 is S = n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o , then L = Z p , which is generated by the G-orbit of any of the standard basis vectors of Z p . Otherwise, |S| ≤ p− d . For any 0 ≤ i ≤ p− d , the G-lattice Li (as in Corollary 5.15) is generated by the G-orbit of any of its nonzero binary elements, as the corresponding idealREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI in F2 [x] / (x p − 1) (see (5.1)) is a field. The support length condition then follows from (b) of Lemma 5.14. We can bound the orbit size of a binary vector under a subgroup of Monn (Z) as a function of its support length and |π (G)|. Lemma 5.17. Let n ∈ Z +, let Dn (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monn (Z), and let π : G → Sn be the projection map. Then, for any binary vector v ∈ Z n , we have |Gv| ≤ |supp(v)| |π (G) v| ≤ |supp(v)| |π (G)|. Proof. The number of ways to permute the nonzero entries of v using elements of G is at most |π (G)|. Since Dn (Z) ≤ G, the number of ways to negate the nonzero entries in v using elements of G is 2|supp(v)|. We are now ready to prove symmetric rank bounds. Proposition 5.18. Let p ≥ 7 be a prime number and let G ≤ Monp (Z) be an irreducible group of monomial matrices satisfying −Ip ∈ G and |O2 (G+)| > 1, and let π : G → Sp be the projection map. If the only π (G)-stable subspaces of F p are those in Proposition 5.12, then for any G-lattice L ⊆ Z p , we have symrank (L, G) ≤ p . Proof. First, we show that O2 (G) = Dp (Z). By Corollary 5.7, we know that O2 (G) must correspond to a π (G)-stable subspace of F p . Given our assumptions on these subspaces, the only possibilities for O2 (G) are those in Table 6. Out of these, the only possibilities satisfying the conditions −Ip ∈ G and |O2 (G+)| > 1 is Dp (Z). We may then apply (a) of Lemma 5.14, and Table 7 shows that the only possible nontrivial G-sublattices of Z p are Zp , LE, and L1. Thus, it suffices to find an element v of each of these G-lattices whose Monp (Z)-orbit spans the lattice and satisfies |Monp (Z) v| ≤ p , as |Gv| ≤ |Monp (Z) v|. For Z p , we may choose v to be any standard basis vector ei of Z p , in which case we have |Monp (Z) v| = 2p. For LE, we may choose any v = ei + ej for distinct standard basis vectors ei, ej ∈ Z p , in which case we have |Monp (Z) v| = p · 2 = 2p (p − 1) < 2p (as p ≥ 7). For L1, we choose v = 1, which satisfies |Monp (Z) v| = 2p. Proposition 5.18 now immediately gives the following result, which applies to conjecturally infinitely many primes by Artin's Conjecture on primitive roots [HB86, §1]. Corollary 5.19. Suppose p ≥ 7 is a prime such that 2 is a primitive root modulo p, and suppose G < GLp (Z) is an irreducible finite group satisfying (a) of Proposition 5.2. Then, for any G-lattice L ⊆ Z p , we have symrank (L, G) ≤ p . Proof. Since the multiplicative order of 2 in F × p is d = p − 1, by Lemma 5. the only possible Cp-stable subspaces (and, thus, the only possible π (G)- stable subspaces) of F p are the four listed in Proposition 5.12. 20 B. HEATH For more general prime dimensions p, we consider the various possibilities for π (G) ≤ Sp. Since π (G) contains a p-cycle by assumption, we know that π (G) is a transitive permutation group of prime degree, which turns out to be quite restrictive. Theorem 5.20. [Bur00, p. 177] [Cam99, §7.3, §7.4] If P ≤ Sp is a transitive permutation group of prime degree p, then P satisfies one of the following. (a) P is the symmetric group Sp. (b) P is the alternating group Ap. (c) P is a metacyclic group of order dividing p (p − 1). (d) There exist a prime power q = u t and m ∈ Z+, with (m, q) ∈/ {(2, 2),(2, 3)}, such that p = qm− q− and the socle of P is isomorphic to the m-dimensional projective special linear group PSLm (q) over the finite field with q elements. In this case, |P| ≤ |PSLm (q)| gcd (m, q − 1)t. Because of (d) in Theorem 5.20, the following formula will be useful. Proposition 5.21. [Wil09, §3.3.1] For all m ≥ 2 and prime powers q, we have |PSLm (q)| = q m(m−1)/ gcd (m, q − 1) Ym i= q i − . We now prove an asymptotic result about symmetric ranks in prime dimensions. Theorem 5.22. For all a ∈ Z +, there exists Na ∈ Z+ such that, for all primes p ≥ Na for which the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is equal to p− a and all irreducible finite subgroups G < GLp (Z) satisfying (a) of Proposition 5.2, we have symrank (Z p , G) ≤ p . Proof. Fix a ∈ Z +, and suppose that p ∈ Z+ is a prime such that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is equal to d = p− a . By (a) of Proposition 5.2 and Proposition 5.3, it suffices to consider G ≤ Monp (Z) satisfying −Ip ∈ G and O + (G) > 1, and primitive G-sublattices L ⊆ Z p . By (c) of Observation 5.4 and (a) of Proposition 5.2, we have O2 (G) ∼= C dℓ+ ∼= C ℓ(p−1)/a+ for some integer 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ a. By Lemma 5.6, we have G ∼= O2 (G) ⋊ π (G), where π : G → Sp is the projection map. Since π (G) contains a p-cycle by (a) of Proposition 5.2, we may proceed by considering the possibilities for π (G) given by Theorem 5.20. Case I: If π (G) ∈ {Ap, Sp}, then we are done by Propositions 5.12 and 5.18. Case II: Assume that π (G) is a metacyclic group of order dividing p (p − 1). We then have |π (G)| ≤ p (p − 1), so |G| ≤ ℓ(p−1)/a+1p (p − 1).REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Subcase i: Suppose 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ a − 1. Then, (a) of Lemma 2.6 gives the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ |G| p ≤ ℓ(p−1)/a+1p (p − 1) ≤ (a−1)(p−1)/a+1p (p − 1). Thus, it suffices to show that 2pis greater than or equal to the rightmost expression. This is equivalent to verifying the inequality (p−1)/a ≥ p (p − 1). Since a is fixed, this inequality is satisfied for sufficiently large p. Subcase ii: Suppose ℓ = a. Then, we have O2 (G) ∼= C p , so Dp (Z) ≤ G. Thus, we apply (a) of Lemma 2.6, Corollary 5.16, and Lemma 5.17 to attain the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ a · ⌊2p/3⌋ p (p − 1). Similar to subcase (i), it suffices to verify that p/3 ≥ ap (p − 1), which holds for sufficiently large p since a is fixed. Case III: Assume that π (G) satisfies (d) of Theorem 5.20; in particular, suppose the socle of G is isomorphic to PSLm (q), where q = u t for some prime u and t ∈ Z +. Note that we have p = qm− q− in this case. Observe that 2 ≤ q ≤ p and that m = logq[p (q − 1) + 1]. We proceed by considering the same two subcases as in case II. Subcase i: Suppose 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ a − 1. In this case, we have |G| ≤ ℓ(p−1)/a+ · q m(m−1)/ gcd (m, q − 1) · Ym i= q i − · t · gcd (m, q − 1). Using some algebra, (a) of Lemma 2.6, and the fact that ℓ ≤ a − 1, we see that it suffices to verify the following inequality: (5.2) 2 p− a ≥ q m(m−1)/ · Ym i= q i − · t · p. To this end, observe that Ym i= q i − < Ym i= q i = q Pm i=2 i = q m(m+1)/2− . In particular, q m(m−1)/ q m(m+1)/2−1 = qm2− . Since 2 ≤ q ≤ p, we have m = logq[p (q − 1) + 1] ≤ logq p 2 + ≤ log p 2 + . Therefore, q m2−1 < qm ≤ q logq(p 2+1)·log2(p2+1) = p 2 + 1log2(p 2+1) .22 B. HEATH Further, since the prime u must be at least 2, we have t = logu(q) ≤ log2(q) ≤ log2(p). Thus, we obtain the following inequality which is stronger than inequality (5.2): p− a ≥ p 2 + 1log2(p 2+1) · log2(p) · p. Since a is fixed, this inequality holds for sufficiently large p, as desired. Subcase ii: Suppose ℓ = a. In this case, we have O2 (G) = Dp (Z). Thus, we apply Corollary 5.16 and Lemma 5.17 to attain the following bound: symrank (L, G) ≤ p − d · ⌊2p/3⌋ · |π (G)| ≤ a · ⌊2p/3⌋ · q m(m−1)/ gcd (m, q − 1) · Ym i= q i − · gcd (m, q − 1) · t = a · ⌊2p/3⌋ · q m(m−1)/2 Ym i= q i − · t. Applying the bounds derived in subcase (i) and removing the floor from the exponent of the 2, it suffices to verify the following inequality: p/3 ≥ a · p 2 + 1log2(p 2+1) · log2(p). Since a is fixed, this inequality holds for all sufficiently large p, completing the proof. In particular, Corollary 5.19 asserts that when a = 1, we can take N1 = 2; in other words, symrankirr (p) ≤ p for all primes p for which the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is p − 1. We now show the same result in the a = case. Theorem 5.23. If p ≥ 7 is a prime number such that the order of 2 modulo p is p− , and G < GLp (Z) is an irreducible finite subgroup satisfying (a) of Proposition 5.2, then symrank (Z p , G) ≤ p . Proof. We follow the proof of Theorem 5.22, with a = 2. In particular, we must have ℓ ∈ {1, 2}. Note that the case p ≤ 23 is addressed in Chapter 4, so it suffices to prove the claim for primes p ≥ 41. The justification given for case I of Theorem 5.22 applies here as well, so we proceed to case II. Case II: Assume that π (G) is a metacyclic group of order dividing p (p − 1). As above, we have |G| ≤ ℓ(p−1)/2+1p (p − 1). Subcase i: If ℓ = 1, then (a) of Lemma 2.6 gives the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ |G| p = 2(p−1)/2+1p (p − 1), and the right hand side is less than or equal to 2pfor p ≥ 31 (verified using a computer algebra system).REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Subcase ii: If ℓ = 2, then Dp (Z) ≤ G, so we apply (a) of Lemma 2.6, Corollary 5.16, and Lemma 5.17 to attain the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ 2 · ⌊2p/3⌋ p (p − 1). The right hand side is less than or equal to 2pfor all p ≥ 31 (verified using a computer algebra system). Case III: Assume that π (G) satisfies (d) of Theorem 5.20; in particular, suppose the socle of G is isomorphic to PSLm (q), where q = u t for some prime u and t ∈ Z +. Note that we have p = qm− q− in this case. By [BS62, Table II], the first prime p of this form that is at least 41 and satisfies the condition that d = p− is the prime p = 2801, obtained by q = 7 and m = 5. Following the ideas in case III of the proof of Theorem 5.22, we find that p ≥ symrank (L, G) for p ≥ 760 when ℓ = 1 and for p ≥ 1297 when ℓ = 2. As 760 < 1297 < 2801, this completes the proof. 6. Almost Simple Groups in Prime Dimensions Let p ≥ 3 be a prime. Recall that (b) of Proposition 5.2 says the following about an irreducible finite matrix group G < GLp (Z): The group O2 (G+) = 1; the group G+ has a unique minimal normal subgroup N 6= 1 (possibly N = G+); the group N is nonabelian simple; the centralizer CG+ (N) = 1; and N is irreducible as a matrix group. In this section, we prove the following theorem. Theorem 6.1. Let p ≥ 7 be a prime number and let G < GLp (Z) be an irreducible finite group satisfying (b) of Proposition 5.2. Then, for any Glattice L ⊆ Z p , we have symrank (L, G) ≤ p . Theorem 4.5 implies Theorem 6.1 for p ∈ {7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}, so it suffices to consider p ≥ 29 in this section. Further, observe that, together with Theorem 4.5, Corollary 5.19, and Theorems 5.22 and 5.23, Theorem 6.1 completes the proof of Theorems 1.4 and 1.3. In fact, Theorem 6.1 gives us something stronger, as this theorem does not have any restrictions on the order of 2 modulo p. Throughout this section, we let G < GLp (Z) be an irreducible finite group for some prime p ≥ 29. We assume that G+ satisfies (b) of Proposition 5.2; in particular, we have S E G+ ≤ Aut (S) for some nonabelian finite simple group S, so G+ is an almost simple group. We will follow notation from [CCN+85] for the finite simple groups. For an abstract group S, we write rdim (S) for the minimal degree of a faithful representation of S. It will be useful to have bounds on rdim (S) when S is a finite simple group. In many cases, bounds on the degrees of projective representations of finite simple groups are more accessible. To that end, recall that a projective representation of a group G is an injective group homomorphism G ֒→ PGLn (k) for some n ∈ Z + and some field k, where PGLn (k) is the n-dimensional projective general linear group over k. We now define the following analogue of representation dimension.24 B. HEATH Definition 6.2. We define the projective representation dimension of a group G, denoted prdim (G), to be the minimal n ∈ Z + for which G admits a projective representation G ֒→ PGLn (k) for some field k. Lemma 6.3. For all finite simple groups S, we have prdim (S) ≤ rdim (S). Proof. Suppose ρ : S ֒→ GLn (k) is a representation for some n ∈ Z + and some field k, and consider the quotient map φ : GLn (k) → PGLn (k). Since S is simple, it follows that the restriction of φ to ρ (S) is injective. Thus, the map φ ◦ ρ is a faithful projective representation of S of the same degree as ρ. Our goal is now to apply (a) of Lemma 2.6 to develop a bound on symrank (L, G) that is dependent only upon S. We start with a general numerical observation. Lemma 6.4. For all a, b, c ∈ Z +, if b ≥ a and 2a ≥ ac, then 2b ≥ bc. Proof. Since 2a ≥ ac ≥ c and 2b−a − 1 ≥ b − a, we have b − 2a = 2a b−a − ≥ c (b − a) = bc − ac, and the claim follows. Lemma 6.5. Suppose S E G+ ≤ Aut (S) for some nonabelian finite simple group S and irreducible finite matrix group G < GLp (Z) for p ≥ 29 prime. If S satisfies any of the following inequalities, then symrank (L, G) ≤ p for all G-lattices L ⊆ Z p . (6.1) 2rdim(S) ≥ 2 |Aut (S)|rdim (S) (6.2) 2prdim(S) ≥ 2 |Aut (S)| prdim (S) (6.3) 229 ≥ 58 |Aut (S)| Proof. The first inequality follows from (a) of Lemma 2.6, Lemma 6.4, and the observations that rdim (S) ≤ rdim (G) and |G| = G + ≤ 2 |Aut (S)| . The second inequality follows from the first inequality and Lemmas 6.4 and 6.3. The third inequality follows from the first inequality, Lemma 6.4, and Theorem 4.5. We now prove Theorem 6.1. Proof of Theorem 6.1. We consider three cases: when S is the alternating group An for some n ≥ 5, when S is a member of another infinite family of finite simple groups, and when S is one of the sporadic finite simple groups (although the methodologies in the second and third cases are essentially the same). Case I: Suppose that S ∼= An for some n ≥ 5. By [JK84, Thm. 2.5.7], all irreducible rational representations of An are restrictions of irreducibleREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI rational representations of the full symmetric group Sn. Thus, by (c) of Lemma 2.6, it suffices to consider the case G+ ∼= Sn. By Theorem 2.3. of [JK84], the degree of an irreducible representation of Sn divides n!, and Theorem 3.4.10.ii of the same text states that the minimal degree of a faithful irreducible representation of Sn is equal to n−1. Furthermore, Theorem 3.4.10.iii of [JK84] says that for n ≥ 6, there does not exist a faithful irreducible representation of Sn of degree n. It now follows that the only possible prime degree of an irreducible representation of Sn is n − 1. The Weyl group W = W (An−1) ∼= Sn, so all G+-lattices (and, thus, all G-lattices) of rank n − 1 are W-lattices of the same rank. Therefore, since |G| = 2 |G+|, the desired bound now follows from Theorem 3.4. Case II: Suppose S is a member of one of the infinite families of finite simple groups aside from the alternating groups. We first apply Lemma 6. to each of the infinite families of finite simple groups to verify Theorem 6. for all but finitely many cases; see Table 8 for details. In each case, the strategy is to verify one of the inequalities in Lemma 6.5 for some value(s) of m and/or q, and then prove that as m and/or q increase the appropriate inequality still holds. For the remaining cases, we use [CCN+85] and a computer algebra system to find the minimal possible prime p such that a faithful representation of a group G satisfying S E G ≤ Aut (S) exists. By Lemma 6.4, it suffices to verify the inequality 2p ≥ 2 |Aut (S)| p in these cases. This is shown in Table 9. After using this approach, there are no more cases to consider. Case III: Assume that S is one of the 26 sporadic finite simple groups. We begin by applying Lemma 6.5 to each group, getting group information from [CCN+85]. This strategy proves the theorem for all but the following six groups: M23, M24, Co3, Co2, HS, and Mc L. For none of these six groups does there exist a potential S E G ≤ Aut (S) such that G admits an irreducible representation in prime degree p ≥ 29, so we are done. 26 B. HEATH Table 8.

      "2. For a typical U, Lemmas III.3 and IV.1 together imply that X j> λ j = O |A| . (30) Thus, aside from λ1, the eigenvalues λj must be quite small. A typical eigenvalue distribution is plotted in Figure 1. If we define λ˜ j = λj/(1 − λ1), then P j>1 λ˜ j = 1 and H1(λ˜) ≥ H2(λ˜) = − lnX j> λ˜ j = 2 ln |A| − O(1). (31) An application of the grouping property then gives us a good lower bound on the von Neumann entropy: H (N ⊗ N¯ )(Φ)= H1(λ) = h(λ1) + (1 − λ1)H1(λ˜) = 2 ln |A| − O(1), (32) 0 100 200 300 400 500 10− 10− 10− 10− 10− Spectrum of the output density operator Eigenvalue index Eigenvalue FIG. 1: Typical eigenvalue spectrum of (N ⊗ N¯ )(Φ) when |R| = 3 and |A| = |B| = 24. The eigenvalues are plotted in increasing order from left to right. The green dashed line corresponds to |S|/(|A||B|) = 1/3, which is essentially equal to the largest eigenvalue. The red solid line represents the value (1− |S| |A||B| )/|A| 2 = 1/864. If the density operator were maximally mixed aside from its largest eigenvalue, all but that one eigenvalue would fall on this line. While that is not the case here or in general, the remaining eigenvalues are nonetheless sufficiently small to ensure that the density operator has high von Neumann entropy. where h is the binary entropy function. This entropy is nearly as large as it can be and, in particular, as large as Hmin(N ) + Hmin(N¯ ) according to Theorem IV.1 of [50], the von Neumann entropy version of Lemma III.2. V. DISCUSSION The counterexamples presented here demonstrate that the maximal p-norm multiplicativity conjecture and, equivalently, the minimum output p-R´enyi entropy conjecture are false for all 1 < p ≤ ∞. The primary motivation for studying this conjecture was that it is a natural strengthening of the minimum (von Neumann) output entropy conjecture, which is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory. In particular, since the multiplicativity conjecture was formulated, most attempts to prove the minimum output entropy conjecture for special cases actually proved maximal p-norm multiplicativity and then took the limit as p decreases to 1. This strategy, we now know, cannot be used to prove the conjecture in general. From that perspective, it would seem that the results in this paper cast doubt on the validity of the minimum output entropy conjecture itself. However, as we have shown, the examples explored here appear to be completely consistent with the conjecture, precisely because the von Neumann entropy is more difficult to perturb than the R´enyi entropies of order p > 1. It is therefore still possible that the p = 1 conjecture could be demonstrated using subtle variants of p-norm multiplicativity such as exact or approximate multiplicativity in a channel-dependent interval (1, 1 + δ). Another strategy that is still open would be to approach the von Neumann minimum output entropy via R´enyi entropies for p < 1. It is possible that additivity holds there even as it fails for p > 1. That is not, unfortunately, a very well-informed speculation. With few exceptions [57], there has been very little research on the additivity question in the regime p < 1, even though many arguments can be easily adapted to this parameter region. (Eq. (13), for example, holds for all 0 < p.) Unfortunately, since the time the examples presented here were first circulated, counterexamples for p close to 0 were also discovered [58], casting doubt on the conjecture for the whole set of R´enyi entropies with p < 1. Indeed, as in the current paper, those examples are based on influencing a single eigenvalue of the output state of the tensor product channel; while here we increase the largest one, there the smallest is suppressed. Thus, while it seems doubtful that the examples of channels presented here will have direct implications for the addivity of the minimum von Neumann entropy, we think that they are still very useful as a new class of test cases. Indeed, as we remarked earlier, our examples eliminate what had been the previously favoured route to the conjecture via the output p-norms. As a final comment, while this paper has demonstrated that the maximal p-norm additivity conjecture fails for p > 1, all the counterexamples presented here have been nonconstructive. For the examples based on ǫ-randomizing maps, all the known explicit constructions (by Ambainis and Smith [59] or via iterated quantum expander maps [60, 61]) only give bounds in the 2-norm, which do imply bounds on the output p-norm but those are too weak to yield counterexamples to multiplicativity. Likewise, the counterexamples based on generic quantum channels rely on the existence of large subspaces containing only highly entangled states. Even when the entanglement is quantified using von Neumann entropy, in which case the existence of these subspaces was demonstrated in 2003 [50], not a single explicit construction is known. The culprit, as in many other related contexts [62], is our use of the probabilistic method. Since we don't have any explicit counterexamples, only a proof that counterexamples exist, it remains an open problem to \"derandomize\" our argument.

We will estimate the integral, in what is perhaps not the most illuminating way, by expressing it in terms of the matrix entries of U. Let Us,ab = Rh0| S hs|U|ai A|biB. Expanding gives Z Tr h (N ⊗ N¯ )(|ΦihΦ|) i dU (A1) = |S| X a1,a a ′ ,a′ X b1,b b ′ ,b′ X s1,s s ′ ,s′ Z U¯ s1,a2b2U¯ s2,a′ b1U¯s ′ ,a′ b ′ U¯ s ′ ,a1b ′ Us1,a1b1Us2,a′ b2Us ′ ,a′ b ′ Us ′ ,a2b ′ dU. Following [63, 64], the non-zero terms in the sum can be represented using a simple graphical notation. Make two parallel columns of four dots, then label the left-hand dots by the indices (s1, s2, s′ , s′ ) and the right-hand dots by the indices ~v = (a2b2, a′ b1, a′ b ′ , a1b ′ ). Join dots with a solid line if the corresponding U¯ matrix entry appears in Eq. (A1). Since terms integrate to a nonzero value only if the vector of U indices ~w = (a1b1, a′ b2, a′ b ′ , a2b ′ ) is a permutation of the vector of U¯ indices, a non-zero integral can be represented by using a dotted line to connect left-hand and right-hand dots whenever the corresponding U matrix entry appears in the integral. Assuming for the moment that the vertex labels in the left column are all distinct and likewise for the right column, the integral evaluates to the Weingarten function Wg(π), where π is the permutation such that wi = vπ(i). For the rough estimate required here, it is sufficient to know that Wg(π) = Θ(|A||B|) −4−|π| , where |π| is the minimal number of factors required to write π as a product of transpositions, and that Wg(e) = (|A||B|) − 1 + O(|A| − |B| − ) [65]. The dominant contribution to Eq. (A1) comes from the \"stack\" diagram • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ , in which the solid and dashed lines are parallel and for which the contribution is positive and approximately equal to |S| X a1,a a ′ ,a′ X b1,b b ′ ,b′ X s1,s s ′ ,s′ δa1a2δb1b2δa ′ a ′ δb ′ b ′ 2 Wg(id) = |S| |A| 2|B| 1 + O(|A| − |B| − ) . (A2) (The expression on the left-hand side would be exact but for the terms in which vertex labels are not distinct.) To obtain an estimate of Eq. (A1), it is then sufficient to examine the other terms and confirm that they are all of smaller asymptotic order than this. There are six diagrams representing transpositions, and their associated (negative) contributions are • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a2b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b ′ N N N N p p p p Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a2b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b = = = = = Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a2b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a1b1, Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ p p p p N N N N Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a1b a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ = = = = = Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b a ′ b1 = a1b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ N N N N p p p p Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ). For permutations π such that |π| > 1, the Weingarten function is significantly suppressed: Wg(π) = O(|A| − |B| − ). Moreover, for a given diagram type, the requirement that wi = vπ(i) can only hold if at least two pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. The contribution from such diagrams is therefore O(|S| |A| − |B| − ). To finish the proof, it is necessary to consider integrals in which the vertex labels on the left- or the right-hand side of a diagram are not all distinct. In this more general case, choosing a set C of representatives for the conjugacy classes of the permutation group on four elements, the value of the integral can be written X c∈C N(c)Wg(c), (A3) where N(c) = X σ∈S : ~v=σ(~v) X τ∈S : ~w=τ(~w) δ(τπσ ∈ c). (A4) These formulas have a simple interpretation. Symmetry in the vertex labels introduces ambiguities in the diagrammatic notation; the formula states that every one of the diagrams consistent with a given vertex label set must be counted, and with a defined dimension-independent multiplicity. Conveniently, our crude estimates have already done exactly that, ignoring the multiplicities. The only case for which we need to know the multiplicities, moreover, is for contributions to the dominant term, which we want to know exactly and not just up to a constant multiple. We claim that in the sum (A1) there are at most O(|S| |A||B| ) terms with vertex label symmetry. The total contribution for terms with vertex label symmetries τ and σ in which |τπσ| ≥ 1 is therefore of size O(|S| |A| − |B| − ) and does not affect the dominant term. To see why the claim holds, fix a diagram type and recall that the requirement wi = vπ(i)for a permutation π can only hold if at least two pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. Equality is achieved only when all the A indices or all the B indices are aligned, corresponding to the following two diagrams: • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b a ′ b1 = a1b a ′ b ′ 2 = a2b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b ′ N N N N p p p p N N N N p p p p • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a2b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b a1b ′ 1 = a1b N N N N p p p p For the first diagram, using the fact that |A| ≤ |B| ≤ |S|, it is easy to check that imposing the extra constraint that either the top or bottom two S or AB vertex labels match singles at most O(|S| |A||B| ) terms from Eq. (A1). Similar reasoning applies to the second diagram, but imposing the constraint instead on rows one and four, or two and three. For all other diagram types, at least four pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. (The number of matching A and B indices is necessarily even.) In a term for which the vertex labels are not all distinct, either a pair of S indices or a further pair of A or B indices must be identical. In the latter case, there must exist an identical A pair and an identical B pair among all the pairs. Again using |A| ≤ |B| ≤ |S|, there can be at most O(|S| |B| ) such terms per diagram type, which demonstrates the claim. We are thus left to consider integrals with vertex label symmetry and N(e) 6= 0 in Eq. (A3). If N(e) = 1, then our counting was correct and there is no problem. It is therefore sufficient to bound the number of integrals in which N(e) > 1. This can occur only in terms with at least 2 vertex label symmetries. Running the argument of the previous paragraph again, for the two diagrams with A or B indices all aligned, this occurs in at most O(|S| |B| ) terms. For the rest of the cases, it is necessary to impose equality on yet another pair of indices, leading again to at most O(|S| |B| ) terms. Since Wg(e) = O(|A| − |B| − ), these contributions are collectively O(|S| |A| − |B| − ). The bound on the error term in Eq. (29) arises by substituting the inequalities |S| ≤ |A||B| and |A| ≤ |B| into each of the estimates calculated above. [1] B. Schumacher. Quantum coding. Physical Review A, 51:2738–2747, 1995. [2] R.

      "1. Introduction Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring. To paraphrase Huneke in [8], the unsubtle finiteness condition that each ideal of R is finitely generated often, in fact, implies subtle forms of finiteness in the ring, many of which are \"uniform.\" By \"uniform\" we mean, for instance, that one element may annihilate the homology of an entire class of complexes, or that an integer known to exist for a certain finite set of data (e.g., a finitely generated module and submodule, along with an ideal), may actually apply uniformly to an infinite data set. The Main Theorem, Theorem 1. below, is of the latter form, but in order to prove it, we have been led to the notion of what we call a Koszul annihilating sequence, which shows a form of finiteness of the former type. Let R be a Noetherian ring and let M ⊆ N be finitely generated R-modules. For an ideal I ⊆ R, the classical Artin-Rees Lemma states that there exists an integer h, depending on the ideal I and the inclusion M ⊆ N, such that for all integers n > h, the equality (1.0.1) I nN ∩ M = In−h (I hN ∩ M) holds. A weaker form of this statement, which is often used in applications, is that for all integers n > h, the following inclusion holds: (1.0.2) I nN ∩ M ⊆ In−hM. The proof of the equality in equation 1.0.1 uses the fact that the associated graded ring of R with respect to I and the associated graded modules of M and N with respect to I are Noetherian. With this approach, the integer h above, which is referred to as the Artin-Rees number, clearly depends on all of the data, that is, on I and on M ⊆ N. Eisenbud and Hochster, in [5], first raised the question of whether or not there might be an integer h as in equality 1.0.1 which, given M ⊆ N, works for all the maximal ideals in the ring R. In this paper, the term \"uniform Artin-Rees\" was used for the first time, and an example in a non-excellent ring was given to show that some condition on the ring is required in order to find a uniform Artin-Rees number that works for all maximal ideals. In fact, for excellent rings, Duncan and O'Carroll in [3] obtained a uniform Artin-Rees number for which equation 1.0. holds for every maximal ideal, answering Eisenbud and Hochster's question. Their work was preceeded by O'Carroll, who proved in [10] that an integer h can be chosen to uniformly satisfy Date: September 8, 2021. The third author was supported by an AWM grant from May12th to June 12th, 2009. The grant was used to visit the first author. 12 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI inclusion 1.0.2 for all maximal ideals of an excellent ring. In [8], Huneke showed that, given the inclusion M ⊆ N, the integer h in inclusion 1.0.2 can be chosen independently of the ideal I under mild assumptions on the ring, for example when the ring is essentially of finite type over a local ring (by \"local\" we include the condition of being Noetherian). Huneke's result gives a lot of information even in a local ring, whereas the O'Carroll and Duncan/O'Carroll results have content only in rings with infinitely many maximal ideals. Our focus in this paper will remain on local rings, with an emphasis on uniform results over the set of all ideals. The impetus for our results is a \"uniform Artin-Rees\" problem raised by Eisenbud and Huneke in [6], concerning uniform bounds of Artin-Rees type on free resolutions. Let M be a finitely generated R-module and let (F•, ∂•) be a free resolution of M by finitely generated free modules: . . . /Fi+ ∂i+ /Fi/ . . . /F ∂ /F /M / 0. We define a module M to be syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to a family of ideals I, if there exists a uniform integer h such that for every n > h, for every i > 0, and for every I ∈ I, I nFi ∩ Im ∂i+1 ⊆ In−h (1.0.3) Im ∂i+1. This definition does not depend on the free resolution (see for example Lemma 2.1 in [11]). Eisenbud and Huneke raise the question (Question B in [6]) of whether or not, given a local ring (R, m) and an ideal I ⊆ R, every module is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to I = {I}. In [6], the authors show that given a local ring (R, m), a module M is syzygetically ArtinRees with respect to an ideal I ⊆ R, if M has finite projective dimension and constant rank on the punctured spectrum. In [11], the third author of this paper observed that much stronger statements could be made if one looks at high enough syzygies. She proved that every second syzygy module in a local ring of dimension at most two has a certain uniform annihilation property with respect to the family of m-primary ideals (see Theorem 5.4 of [11]). Although it is never formally stated in her paper, one can deduce from her results that in a local ring of dimension two, every finitely generated second syzygy is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to the set of m-primary ideals, and that the integer h in inclusion 1.0.3 can be chosen independently of the module M, i.e., we have a double uniform Artin-Rees theorem. This leads us to an extended definition: We say that a family of modules M is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to a family of ideals I if there exists an h such that inclusion 1.0.3 holds for every module of M and every ideal of I. It is in this form that we prove our main theorem. (1.1) Main Theorem. Let (R, m) be a local Noetherian ring of dimension d. Then, the family of finitely generated dth syzygy modules is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to the family of all ideals. It quickly becomes apparent, when considering this problem over infinite sets of ideals and modules, that no uniform statement is possible when we consider the beginning of a resolution, even in very nice rings. Suppose that (R, m) is Cohen-Macaulay (or even regular) and x1, . . . , xd is a system of parameters. The Koszul complex K•(x t , . . . , xt d ; R) is a free resolution of the module R/(x t , . . . , xt d ). This complex will have Artin-Rees number at least t for the ideal (x1, . . . , xd). But there is a uniform behavior for all such complexes past d, since all higher syzygies are zero. The syzygetically Artin-Rees property is intertwined with finding uniform annihilators for homology modules. In fact, given a free resolution (F•, ∂•) of an R-module M, there is an isomorphism I nFi−1 ∩ Im(∂i) I nIm ∂i ∼= TorR i (R/In(1.1.1) , M), for every i > 1.UNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES Our work to find uniform annihilator elements for the homology module displayed above, is inspired by the ideas contained in the monograph [7], which also relate to important homological conjectures. In this monograph, the authors show that elements that annihilate higher homology modules of Koszul complexes on sequences that are part of a system of parameters, can often, after taking a power, annihilate higher homology modules of a much wider class of complexes. Huneke's proof of his uniform Artin-Rees and uniform Brian¸con-Skoda theorems also relies heavily on such elements. In order to prove our Main Theorem, given a local ring (R, m), we need a sequence of elements which annihilate higher Koszul homology modules of parameters. As we need this sequence to itself form a system of parameters, we are forced to choose elements that annihilate higher Koszul homology of part of system of parameters of appropriate length. This leads us to introduce the notion of Koszul annihilating sequence (KAS), whose precise definition, Definition 2.3, is given in Section 2, together with the proof of its existence, Theorem 2.6. We believe that KAS sequences may offer a significant tool in problems where controlling higher homology modules for classes of free complexes is important. Section 3 is devoted to showing how Koszul annihilating sequences uniformly annihilate the homology modules of a much larger class of complexes. Finally, in Section 4, after proving several lemmas, we give the proof of Theorem 4.8 of which the Main Theorem is a corollary. 2. Koszul annihilating sequences Throughout this section, R will denote a Noetherian ring of dimension d. Let x = x1, . . . , xn be a sequence of elements in R, and let M be an R-module. We denote the Koszul complex on the sequence x and the module M by K•(x1, . . . , xn; M), and we denote its ith homology by Hi(x1, . . . , xn; M). This section is devoted to showing, given a local ring (R, m), the existence of a system of parameters, which we call a Koszul annihilating sequence (or KAS), whose elements uniformly annihilate higher homology modules of the Koszul complex on sequences that are part of a system of parameters against all modules that are high syzygies. The precise definition of KAS is given in Definition 2.3, and the existence of such a sequence for the class of dth szyzygies is the content of Theorem 2.6. As mentioned in the introduction, our work is inspired by the monograph of Hochster and Huneke. The first result we need to modify is the following which is Theorem (2.16) of [7]. For a finitely generated module M, the height of I on M, htM I, is the height of the ideal I in the ring R/ AnnR M. (2.1) Let R be a Noetherian ring, not necessarily local. Let x1, . . . , xn be elements in the ring R and suppose that M is a finitely generated R-module of dimension d ′ such that the inequality htM(x1, . . . , xi) > i is satisfied for all i = 1, . . . , n. Let c be an element of R such that, for i = 0, . . . , n − 1, the equality cHi pRp (Mp) = 0 holds for any prime ideal p containing the elements x1, . . . , xi+1. Then the equality c E(d ′ ,n,t)Hn−t(x1, . . . , xn; M) = 0 holds for 0 6 t 6 n − 1, where, for integers δ > ν > τ > 0, the function E(δ, ν, τ) is defined recursively as follows: ( E(δ, ν, 0) = δ − ν + E(δ, ν, τ) = δ + (δ + 2)E(δ, ν − 1, τ − 1), τ > 1. We provide here an alternative version of result 2.1, with essentially the same proof as given in [7]. With stronger hypotheses on R, we may look only at the height of the sequence on R (not on the module M), and we may drop the dimension assumption on M. This is valuable for4 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI our applications to syzygies as we do not always know that syzygies have the full dimension of the ring. On the other hand, the hypotheses on the ring will be satisfied as we will apply our theorem to Gorenstein rings. In our case, we define a new function E1(δ, ν, τ) recursively by ( E1(δ, ν, 0) = δ − ν + E1(δ, ν, τ) = δ + (δ + 2)E1(δ − 1, ν − 1, τ − 1), τ > 1. (2.2) Theorem. Let R be a Noetherian ring of dimension d which is catenary and locally equidimensional at each maximal ideal. Let x = x1, . . . , xn be a sequence of elements of R for which the inequality htR(x1, . . . , xi)R > i holds for all integers i with 1 6 i 6 n. Let M be a finitely generated R-module, and let c ∈ R be an element such that the equality cHi pRp (Mp) = 0 holds for any prime ideal p containing the sequence x1, . . . , xi+1 and for 0 6 i 6 n − 1. Then, the equality c E1(d,n,t)Hn−t(x; M) = 0 holds for 0 6 t 6 n − 1. Proof. We use induction on d, n, and t. The property of being equidimensional at maximal ideals localizes and the statement is a local one on R at maximal ideals. Moreover, if m is a maximal ideal of R then htR m 6 d. Since for d ′ 6 d we have E1(d′ , n, t) 6 E1(d, n, t), without loss of generality we may assume that (R, m) is a local Noetherian catenary and equidimensional ring of dimension d. If t = 0, we shall show that Hn(x; M) is annihilated by c d−n+1. We can assume that n > 1. If n > d, then (x)R = R and all Koszul homologies vanish. If d = n, then (x) generates an m-primary ideal and Hn(x; M) ⊆ H m(M), which is annihilated by c by hypothesis. We may thus assume that n < d. Consider c d−nHn(x; M). By the induction hypothesis on d, this module vanishes on the punctured spectrum. The module is also a submodule of M, and hence c d−nHn(x; M) ⊆ H m(M). By hypothesis, c is in the annihilator of the module c d−nHn(x; M). We now assume that t > 0. Let N = annM (x1) = H1(x1; M). We may apply the case t = and n = 1 to see that c d is in the annihilator of the module N. Consider the two exact sequences (2.2.1) 0 → N → M → M′ → 0, and (2.2.2) 0 → M′ → M → M/x1M → 0, where M′ = x1M ∼= M/N. Let r be an integer with 0 6 r 6 n − 1 and p a prime ideal containing x1, . . . , xr+1. The short exact sequence 2.2.1 yields the following long exact sequence: (2.2.3) · · · → H i pRp (Mp) → Hi pRp (M′ p ) → H i+ pRp (Np) → · · · . Since the equality c dN = 0 holds, then cd is in the annihilator of the third module displayed in 2.2.3 for all i > 0; by hypothesis c annihilates the first module displayed in 2.2.3 for all i 6 r. Thus, for i 6 r, c d+1Hi pRp (M′ p ) = 0. In particular, c d+1 kills the third term displayed below for all i < r (2.2.4) · · · → H i pRp (Mp) → H i pRp ((M/x1M)p) → H i+ pRp (M′ p ) → · · · , where the long exact sequence comes from the short exact sequence 2.2.2. Hence, for all i < r, c d+2 kills the middle term in 2.2.4, since by hypothesis cHi pRp (Mp) = 0 for i 6 r. Because R is equidimensional and catenary of dimension d, the ring R/x1R is equidimensional and catenary of dimension d − 1, and htR ((x2, . . . , xi+1)(R/x1R)) > i. We apply the induction hypothesis with M/x1M replacing M, R/x1R replacing R, x2, . . . , xn replacing the original sequence, c d+2 replacing c, and d − 1, n − 1, t − 1 replacing d, n, and t respectively to conclude that c (d+2)E1(d−1,n−1,t−1) kills Hn−t(x2, . . . , xn; M/x1M).UNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES Finally, from a spectral sequence there is a long exact sequence · · · → Hi−1(x2, . . . , xn; N) → Hi(x; M) → Hi(x2, . . . , xn; M/x1M) → · · · . Let i = n − t. Since c d annihilates the first displayed term and c(d+2)E1(d−1,n−1,t−1) annihilates the third term, we obtain that c E1(d,n,t)Hi(x; M) = 0, as required. We are now ready to give the definition of a Koszul annihilating sequence. (2.3) Definition. Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d and let M be a finitely generated R-module. Given an integer i such that i 6 d, a sequence of elements, ci, ci+1, . . . , cd ∈ m is a Koszul annihilating sequence (KAS) for M (of length d − i + 1), if (1) the elements ci, . . . , cd are part of a system of parameters for R, and (2) for all integers k such that d > k > i − 1, if x1, . . . , xk, ck+1, . . . , cd are a system of parameters for R, then the equality cvHn(x1, . . . , xk, ct k+1, . . . , ctj ; M) = holds for all v > j > k > 1 and for all n, t > 1. If M is a family of finitely generated R-modules, and ci, . . . , cd is a KAS for all M ∈ M, then we will say that the sequence is a KAS for M. (2.4) Remark. It is clear from the definition that if we modify a KAS by replacing each element by a power of itself, we still have a KAS. Moreover a KAS of length dim R is a system of parameters for R. Theorem 2.6 below shows that for any local ring, it is always possible to find a KAS of length d for the class of modules which are dth syzygies. Before proving the theorem, we introduce some ideals that will be used in the proof. (2.5) Let (R, m) be a local ring. For an integer i such that 0 6 i < d, set ai = ai(R) = AnnR Hi m(R) and bi = bi(R) = a0(R)· · · ai(R). It is a simple induction to see that if M is a jth syzygy then for 0 6 i < j, bi ⊆ AnnR Hi m(M). In particular, for every dth syzygy, and for every 0 6 i < d, bi ⊆ AnnR Hi m(M). We also note that b0 ⊇ b1 ⊇ · · · ⊇ bd−1 and dim R/bi 6 i. (2.6) Theorem. Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d. Then, there exists a KAS sequence, c1, . . . , cd, for the family of finitely generated modules which are dth syzygies over R. Moreover, the KAS sequence c1, . . . , cd can be chosen such that the following holds dim R/(0 :R (0 :R cd−i)) 6 d − i − 1, for all 1 6 i 6 d − 1. Proof. We begin by choosing c ′ d ∈ bd−1 − S p∈Assh R p, where Assh R denotes the set of associated prime ideals p of maximal dimension, i.e., dim R/p = dim R. This choice is possible, since dim R/bd−1 6 d − 1 by 2.5, and therefore, by prime avoidance, bd−1 is not contained in any minimal prime of R of maximal dimension. Inductively, having chosen c ′ d , . . . , c′ i+1, we pick c ′ i ∈ bi−1 − [ {p | p ∈ AsshR R/(c ′ i+1, . . . , c′ d )} ∪ {p | p ∈ Ass R, dimR R/p > i} . We can avoid all the above primes in question since dim R/bi−1 6 i − 1 by 2.5. For 1 6 i 6 d, set ci = (c ′ i ) E1(d,d,d−1) . The elements cd, . . . , c1 form a system of parameters in R, and hence in Rb. Let (S, n) be a Gorenstein ring of dimension d mapping onto Rb, say Rb = S/I. Again, using prime avoidance, we6 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI may lift c1, . . . , cd to elements in S which form a system of parameters in S. Abusing terminology, we will continue to call the elements c1, . . . , cd. For all Rb modules, the action of the lifted elements is the same as the action of the ci's. Let M be a finitely generated dth Rb-syzygy. Suppose that x1, . . . , xk ∈ S are elements such that x1, . . . , xk, ck+1, . . . , cd are a system of parameters in S. We want to show that, given integers v > j > k and t, n > 1, the equality cvHn(x1, . . . , xk, ct k+1, . . . , ct j ; M) = 0 holds. By Theorem 2.2, it suffices to show that the equality c ′ vHi pSp (Mp) = 0 holds whenever the index i satisfies 0 6 i 6 j − 1 and the prime ideal p ∈ Spec(S) is such that (y1, . . . , yi+1) ⊆ p, where ym = xm for 1 6 m 6 k and ym = c t m otherwise. Fix an integer i ∈ {0, . . . , j − 1}, by local duality the cohomology module Hi pSp (Mp) is dual to Extht p−i S (M, S)p; further the module Extht p−i S (M, S) is dual to the cohomology module H d−ht p+i n (M). If v > d − ht p + i + 1 then, using 2.5, the equality cvH d−ht p+i n (M) = holds, as the element cv ∈ bv−1 ⊆ bd−ht p+i. Thus we may assume that v < d − ht p + i + 1, or, equivalently, that ht p < d−v +i+ 1. We claim that the ideal p does not contain all the elements cd, . . . , cd−(ht p−i−1). Indeed if p would contain these elements as well as y1, . . . , yi+1, then p contains at least ht p + 1 elements from a system of parameters for the ring S, contradicting the Gorenstein assumption on S. Therefore p does not contain all the elements cd, . . . , cd−(ht p−i−1) so that the module Extht p−i S (M, S)p vanishes, as its annihilator contains the elements cd, . . . , cd−(ht p−i−1). Hence the hypotheses of Theorem 2.2 hold. In particular, this shows that c1, . . . , cd is a KAS for Rb. Note that the elements c1, . . . , cd live in R. Because Rb is faithfully flat over R, if M is a finitely generated dth syzygy over R then M ⊗R Rb is a dth syzygy over Rb. Also, − ⊗R Rb commutes with taking Koszul homology so the vanishing condition over Rb implies the same vanishing over R. Thus c1, . . . , cd is a KAS over R. Since we picked each ci to avoid appropriate associated primes of R, we also have that dim R/(0 :R (0 :R cd−i)) 6 d − i − 1 for each i. KAS sequences annihilate homology modules of Koszul complexes on every sequence x (of appropriate length) that is part of a system of parameters. However, in Lemma 4.6, we will need to carefully choose sequences x with properties that are captured by the following definition. (2.7) Definition. Let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS for a family of modules M. A system of parameters x = x1, . . . , xd is said to be well-suited to c if for all 1 6 i 6 j 6 d, any subset of cardinality d − (j − i + 1) of the sequence x together with the sequence ci, . . . , cj is a system of parameters for R. Using this definition (with j = d and j = d−1 respectively), the two equalities in the following corollary are particular cases of Theorem 2.6. (2.8) Corollary. Let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS sequence for the family of modules which are dth syzygies and let x1, . . . , xd be a well-suited sequence to c. Then cvHt(x1, . . . , xk, ck+1, . . . , cℓ; M) = 0, cvHt(x1, . . . , xk, ck, . . . , cℓ−1; M) = 0, for all integers v > ℓ > k > 1, for all t > 1, and for all R-modules M that are dth syzygies. 3. Uniform annihilators of homology As shown in [7], elements that annihilate the Koszul homology are also in the annihilator of the homology modules of a wider class of complexes. In this section we look at a class ofUNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES complexes described, for instance, in Definition (3.16) of [7] and we study their relations with KAS sequences. Let (G•, ∂•) be a complex of finitely generated free modules: /Gn ∂n /Gn− / . . . /G ∂ /G0/ where n is the length of the complex. For a positive integer r, denote by Ir(∂i) the ideal generated by the r × r minors of a matrix that represents the map ∂i after a choice of basis (the ideal is independent of the choice). The rank of the homomorphism ∂iis given by rank ∂i = max{r | Ir(∂i) 6= 0}. Denote by I(∂i) the ideal Irank ∂i(∂i). The complex (G•, ∂•) satisfies the standard conditions on rank if the following equality holds for i = 1, . . . , n: rankR Gi = rank ∂i + rank ∂i+1. (3.1) The standard conditions on rank play a very important role on the exactness of a complex. Buchsbaum and Eisenbud show in [2] that a complex of free modules /Gn ∂n /Gn− / . . . /G ∂ /G0/ is exact if and only if it satisfies the standard conditions on rank and depthR I(∂i) > i for all integers i > 1. The proof of 3.1 uses several lemmas. We report two of them for easy reference. One could consult Proposition 1.4.10 of [1] or refer to the original paper [2] for a proof. (3.2) Let ∂ : F1 → F0 be a homomorphism between two free R-modules. Denote by M the cokernel of ∂. Then I(∂) = R if and only if M is a free module of rank equal to rank F0−rank(∂). (3.3) Let 0 → Gn → · · · → G0 be a complex of free modules that satisfies the standard conditions on rank. Assume that I(∂i) = R for all i = 1, . . . , n then the complex is split exact. Our first proposition will show how a KAS sequence annihilates the homology of complexes which are the tensor product of high syzygies and certain complexes satisfying the standard conditions on rank. We will use the following result, which is Proposition 3.1 of [7]. The statement in the original publication has a typo, so we restate it here. (3.4) Let R be an arbitrary commutative ring and let M• be a complex 0 → Mn → · · · → M1 → M0 → of arbitrary R-modules. Let x = x1, . . . , xn be a sequence of elements in R, and let d, d0, d1, . . . , dn−2 be elements of R such that (1) di kills Hn−i(M•), for 0 6 i 6 n − 2 (this is where the correction is), and (2) d kills Hn−j (x1, . . . , xn; Mj+1), for 1 6 j 6 n − 1. Then D = (d0d1 . . . dn−2)d n kills HomR(R/(x1, . . . , xn), H1(M•)). (3.5) Proposition. Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d and let c1, . . . , cd be a KAS for the family of modules which are dth syzygies. Then there exists an integer t > 0 such that c t n+jHi(G• ⊗ M) = 0, for all integers i and j such that i > 1, 0 6 j 6 d − n, for every dth syzygy M, and for every complex (G•, ∂•) of length n 6 d of finitely generated free R-modules with the following properties:8 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI (1) G• satisfies the standard conditions on rank, (2) For 1 6 i 6 n, the ideal I(∂i) + (ci+1, . . . , cd) is m-primary. Proof. Denote by bi the rank of the free module Gi. We use reverse induction on the homological degree of the complex G•. At homological degree n, the complex looks like 0 → Gn → Gn−1, with ∂n : Gn → Gn−1. By hypothesis I(∂n) + (cn+1, . . . , cd) is m-primary. Choose elements y1, . . . , yn ∈ I(∂n) such that the sequence y1, . . . , yn, cn+1, . . . , cd forms a system of parameters. Then for each 1 6 i 6 n, we obtain I(∂n)yi= Ryi . The content of 3.2 implies that the cokernel of (∂n)yiis a free module of rank equal to bn−1 − rank(∂n)yi = bn−1 − bn, where the last equality holds since the complex G• satisfies the standard conditions on rank. In particular, the sequence 0 → (Gn)yi → (Gn−1)yi → Coker(∂n)yi → is a split exact sequence. Let M be a dth syzygy and let z ∈ Hn(G•⊗M) ⊆ Gn⊗M. Then (Gn⊗M)yi → (Gn−1⊗M)yi is injective for each i such that 0 6 i 6 n, so there is an integer s such that y s i z = 0 for each i such that 1 6 i 6 n, and therefore z ∈ Hn(y s , . . . , ys n ; Gn ⊗ M). By Corollary 2.8, each of cn, . . . , cd kills this homology, and so each kills z. Suppose that the conclusion holds for all complexes of length n, at each homological degree greater than m (with 1 6 m < n). In particular, there exists an integer k such that c k n , . . . , ck d annihilate Hi(G• ⊗ M) for all i > m. We need to show that there is a power of the elements cn, . . . , cd that annihilates Hm(G• ⊗ M). Pick y1, . . . , ym ∈ I(∂m) such that y1, . . . , ym, cm+1, . . . , cd are a system of parameters. For each 1 6 i 6 m, the localized subcomplex 0 → (Gn)yi → · · · → (Gm)yi → (Gm−1)yiis split exact since the complex satisfies the hypothesis of 3.3. Hence, given a dth syzygy M, there is a power s such that (y s , . . . , ys m) kills the homology Hm(G• ⊗ M). This implies that there is a homomorphism that sends the identity in R/(y s , . . . , ys m) to any element z ∈ Hm(G• ⊗ M). As the elements ci's are part of a KAS, we may now apply the content of 3.4 to the complex (0 → Gn → · · · → Gm−1 → 0) ⊗ M with each d0 = · · · = dn−m−1 = c k j and d = cj for j > n. Thus c (n−m)k+n−m+ j kills the desired homology. We now look at the particular complex we will use. (3.6) Remark. Let x = x1, . . . , xh be a sequence elements of a ring R. Consider the n×(n+h−1) matrix B =   x1 x2 . . . xh 0 . . . . . . 0 x1 x2 . . . xh 0 . . . . . . 0 0 . . . . . . xh   . The n × n minors of B are the generators of the ideal J n, where J = (x1, . . . , xh). In [4] the authors construct a complex (B J,n • , ∂•) such that H0(B J,n • ) = R/Jn. Theorem 2 of [4] says that if x is a regular sequence, then the complex (B J,n • , ∂•) is a free resolution of R/Jn of length h. Moreover, J ⊆ p I(∂i) for all i = 1, . . . , h. Using the particular complex above, we are finally able to list in the following proposition all the results that are used in the next section. (3.7) Proposition. Let (R, m, k) be a local ring of dimension d, let M be the family of all finitely generated R-modules that are dth syzygies,and let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS sequence for M. Let x1, . . . , xd be a system of parameters well-suited to c and denote by Ij the ideal (x1, . . . xj ). LetUNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES t be the integer given by Proposition 3.5 for c. For every i and j such that 1 6 j 6 i 6 n and for any positive integers tj+1, . . . , ti the following hold: (1) the complex (B Ij ,n • , ∂•)⊗K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ; R) (where if j = i there is no Koszul complex) satisfies conditions (1) and (2) of Proposition 3.5; (2) c t k TorR (R/(I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i )), M) = 0, for all M ∈ M and for all k = i, . . . , d; (3) c t k (I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ))G ∩ N ⊆ I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ) N, for all modules N and free modules G such that N ⊆ G and G/N ∈ M, and for all k = i, . . . , d; (4) c t k (I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti− i− ))M : c∞ i ⊆ I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti− i− ) M, for all k = i, . . . , d. Proof. For (1), let S = Z[X1, . . . , Xd, C1, . . . , Cd] be the polynomial ring in 2d variables and define the ring homomorphism ψ : S → R such that ψ(Xj ) = xj and ψ(Cj ) = cj . Denote by Xj the sequence X1, . . . , Xj . By Remark 3.6, the complex B Xj ,n is a free resolution over S of the ideal (X1, . . . , Xj ) n. Since the elements C1, . . . , Cd are a regular sequence over the S-module H0(B Xj ,n) = S/(X1, . . . , Xj ) n, the complex B Xj ,n ⊗S K•(C tj+ j+1 , . . . , Ctii ; S) is a free resolution of S/((X1, . . . , Xj ) n, Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti i ) and therefore it satisfies the standard conditions on rank by 3.1. By induction on the length of the Koszul complex and using 3.6, one can see that each ideal of rank-size minors is, up to radical, the ideal (X1, . . . , Xj , Cj+1, . . . , Ci). Base change to R clearly preserves the rank in this case, as well as condition (2) of Proposition 3.5. For (2), denote by F• a minimal free resolution of R/(I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i )). The complexes F• and BIj ,n ⊗ K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ) are identical up to homological degree 1 and up to a change of base. Therefore, as F• is exact, there is a chain map from BIj ,n ⊗ K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ) to F• that lifts the identity between the free modules of homological degree 1. This chain map induces the following surjection H1(B Ij ,n ⊗ K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ; R) ⊗R M) → TorR (R/(I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i )), M). So it is enough to show that c t kH1(B Ij ,n ⊗ K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i (3.7.1) ; R) ⊗R M) = 0. This follows from part (1) and Proposition 3.5. Statement (3) follows from (2) by isomorphism 1.1.1, for i = 1. For (4), denote the first and the second maps of the complex B Xj ,n ⊗ K•(C tj+ j+1 , . . . , Ctii ; S) by Φ1 and Φ2. Such complex is a free resolution of S/((X1, . . . , Xj) n, Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti i ) and therefore the entries of the last row of a matrix representing Φ2 generate the ideal ((X1, . . . , Xj) n , Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti− i− : C ti i ) which is equal to ((X1, . . . , Xj ) n , Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti− i− ) for each value of ti since the elements X1, . . . , Xj , Cj+1, . . . , Ci form a regular sequence. Let z ∈ (I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti− i− ))M : c∞ i , there exists a tuple z ∈ Ker(Φ1 ⊗S IdM ), for which z is the last entry. Notice that equation 3.7.1 reads c t kKer(Φ1 ⊗R IdM ) ⊆ Im(Φ2 ⊗R IdM ). Therefore, c t k z ∈ Im(Φ2 ⊗S IdM ) = Im(Φ2)⊗S IdM . By reading this inclusion componentwise, we obtain that c t kz ∈ ((X1, . . . , Xj ) n , Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti− i− ) ⊗S M = (I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti− i− ))M, which finishes the proof of the proposition. 10 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI 4. Proof of the Main Theorem In this section, (R, m) will be a local ring of dimension d. If (S, n) is a faithfully flat local extension of R then the conclusion of the Main Theorem descends from S to R. Hence we may always assume that R has an infinite residue field. The idea behind the proof of the Main Theorem is to first pick a KAS, then reduce the statement to families of m-primary ideals generated by minimal reductions (which are then systems of parameters) and then, by picking a generic generating set for the reduction, change the calculation from the reduction to the KAS. Recall that given an ideal I ⊆ R, a reduction of I is an ideal J ⊆ I such that there exists an integer k satisfying the equality I k+1 = JIk , which in turn implies that I n ⊆ Jn−k , for all n > k. If J ⊆ I is a reduction of I then I = J. When (R, m) has an infinite residue field, minimal reductions of an ideal always exist. For a comprehensive treatment one may consult [9]. We will rely heavily on Huneke's Uniform Brian¸con-Skoda Theorem (Theorem 4.13 in [8]). We present it in a less general form which is adequate for our needs. (4.1) Let (R, m, k) be a complete reduced Noetherian ring. There exists a positive integer k such that for all ideals I ⊆ R, the inclusion I n ⊆ I n−k holds for all n > k. Our next theorem shows that the integer k in the definition of a reduction of an ideal can be uniformly chosen to work for all ideals and for all reductions. (4.2) Theorem. Let (R, m, k) be a complete local ring. There exists a positive integer k such that for all ideals I and all reductions J ⊆ I, the inclusion I n ⊆ Jn−k holds for all n > k. Proof. Denote by N the nilradical of the ring R. If N = 0, we are done by Theorem 4.1, since I n ⊆ J n. By Noetherian induction, for any non-zero element x ∈ N, the result holds, since the property of being a reduction is preserved modulo nilpotent elements. We can assume that x 2 = 0. Let k1 be an integer which works mod xR, and let k2 be the UAR number for xR ⊆ R. Then I n ⊆ Jn−k1 + (xR∩In−k1 ) ⊆ Jn−k1 +xIn−k1−k2 ⊆ Jn−k1 +x(Jn−2k1−k2 +xR) ⊆ Jn−2k1−k . We need a notion of reduction that relates to the notion of KAS sequences. (4.3) Definition. Let I be an m-primary ideal and c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS sequence. A special reduction of I with respect to c is a sequence x1, . . . , xd which is well-suited to c and verifies the following, for all integers i such that 0 6 i 6 d − 1: (1) Id−i−1 is a reduction of Id−i modulo (cd−i, . . . , cd) (2) Id−i−1 is a reduction of Id−i modulo (0 : (0 : cd−i)), where Ik denotes the ideal generated by x1, . . . , xk. We also set I0 = 0. (4.4) Remark. Special reductions exist if the residue field is infinite. We need to pick the KAS sequence such that dimR R/(0 : (0 : cd−i)) 6 d − i − 1, and this is possible by Theorem 2.6. Suppose that we have picked a KAS, c = c1, . . . , cd. There are only finitely many ideals generated by the subsets of {c1, . . . , cd}. Thus, with an infinite field, one can choose d general generators of the ideal I that will both be well-suited to c and satisfy the reduction conditions (1) and (2) of Definition 4.3. We now collect the steps that will reduce the proof of the Main Theorem for the family of all ideals to the family of ideals generated by sequences that are special reductions. (4.5) The following statements hold: (1) If the Main Theorem holds for the family of all m-primary ideals then it will hold for the family of all ideals, as I = \\ n> (I + m n ) by the Krull Intersection Theorem.UNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES (2) In view of Theorem 4.2, we can reduce the proof of our Main Theorem to a family of ideals that are special reductions of m-primary ideals. We now present the technique that will allow to use an induction on the number of elements of the sequences. Before we need a technical lemma. (4.6) Lemma. Let (R, m) be a local ring and let N be a dth syzygy. Let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS sequence with respect to the family of modules that are dth syzygies, and let t be the integer given by Proposition 3.5 for c. Assume that the sequence of elements x1, . . . , xd is well-suited to c. Let w be an element in N. If there exists an integer h such that c t jw ∈ (x1, . . . , xj−1) n−hN + (c (i−j+1)t i , . . . , c2t j+1)(x1, . . . , xj ) n−hN, where i > j and 1 6 i 6 d, then there exists w1 ∈ (x1, . . . , xj ) n−hN such that c t j (w − w1) ∈ (x1, . . . , xj−1) n−hN + (c (i−j)t i− , . . . , c2t j+ (x1, . . . , xj ) n−hN. Proof. For notational simplicity, replace each c t k by ck, and let Ik be the ideal (x1, . . . , xk) for every integer k such 1 6 k 6 d. Let vi ∈ (x1, . . . , xj ) n−hN be the coefficient of c i−j+ i . Then c i−j+ i vi ∈ cjN + I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1)I n−h j N. In particular, vi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1, cj )N : c i−j+ i . By Proposition 3.7 (4), (4.6.1) civi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1, cj )N. We claim that for every integer r such that 1 6 r 6 i − j + 1, we have (4.6.2) c r i vi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c i−j−r+ i−r+1 )I n−h j N + (c i−j−r+ i−r , . . . , c j+1, cj )N, and we will prove the claim by induction on r. The claim is true for r = 1 by 4.6.1. Assume the claim is true for r > 1. Let ni−r ∈ N be the coefficient of c i−j−r+ i−r in 4.6.2. Then ni−r ∈ I n−h j + (c i−j−r i−r− , . . . , c j+1, cj ) N : c i−j−r+ i−r . By Proposition 3.7 (4), cini−r ∈ I n−h j + (c i−j−r i−r− , . . . , c j+1, cj ) N. Multiplying 4.6.2 by ci and substituting for cini−r yields c r+ i vi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c i−j−r+ i−r+1 , c i−j−r+ i−r )I n−h j N + (c i−j−r i−r− , . . . , c j+1, cj )N, as desired. Therefore, the claim is true for all r = 1, . . . , i − j + 1. In particular, for r = i − j + 1, we obtain c i−j+ i vi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , cj )I n−h j N. By hypothesis, we have the following containment cjw ∈ I n−h j−1 N + c i−j+ i vi + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1)I n−h j N, which, together with the previous containment, gives cjw ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1, cj)I n−h j N.12 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI We conclude that there exists w1 ∈ I n−h j N such that cj (w − w1) ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1)I n−h j N, which concludes the proof. We will now focus our attention on choosing the sequence x1, . . . , xd to which we can apply the previous lemma. With the same notation as in 4.3, we can state the main reduction that is used to prove the main theorem. (4.7) Proposition. Let (R, m, k) be a local ring of dimension d with an infinite residue field. Let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS-sequence of R, and let 0 → N → G → M → 0 be a short exact sequence of finitely generated R-modules where M is a dth syzygy and G is a free R-module. There exists an integer h, depending only on c, such that if I is an m-primary ideal and x1, . . . , xd is a special reduction of I, then for all integers i such that 0 6 i 6 d − 1 and for all n > h, the following inclusion holds I n d−iG ∩ N ⊆ I n−h d−i N + I n−h d−i−1G ∩ N. Proof. Let t be the exponent for c given by Proposition 3.5. For simplicity of notation, we replace each c t i by ci , for each integer i such that 1 6 i 6 d. By Proposition 3.7 (3) with i = j, cd−i(I n d−iG ∩ N) ⊆ I n d−iN. In particular, given an element w ∈ I n d−iG ∩ N, we obtain cd−iw ∈ I n d−iN. Since Id−i−1 is a reduction of Id−i modulo the ideal (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i), there exists an integer h1, which, by Proposition 4.2, depends only on the KAS sequence c, such that I n d−i ⊆ I n−h d−i−1 + (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)R ∩ I n−h d−i (4.7.1) , for all n > h1. By the uniform Artin-Rees property, there exists an integer h2, depending only on the KAS sequence c, such that (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)R ∩ I n−h d−i ⊆ (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)I n−h1−h d−i . Combining this last inclusion with inclusion 4.7.1, and setting h3 equal to h1 + h2, we obtain I n d−i ⊆ I n−h d−i−1 + (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)I n−h d−i , for all n > h3. Thus the containment cd−iw ∈ I n−h d−i−1N + (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)I n−h d−i N holds. It follows that there exists an element w1 ∈ I n−h d−i N such that cd−i(w − w1) ∈ I n−h d−i−1N + (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1)I n−h d−i N. By a repeated application of Lemma 4.6, there are elements w2, . . . , wi+1 ∈ I n−h d−i N satisfying cd−i(w − w1 − w2 − · · · − wi+1) ∈ I n−h d−i−1N ⊆ I n−h d−i−1G ∩ cd−iG. By the uniform Artin-Rees property, there exists an integer h4 > h3, depending only on the element cd−i, such that I n−h d−i−1G ∩ cd−iG ⊆ cd−iI n−h d−i−1G. So we obtain cd−i(w − w1 − w2 − · · · − wi+1) ∈ cd−iI n−h d−i−1G, for all n > h4. Therefore there exists an element f ∈ I n−h d−i−1G such that cd−i(w − w1 − w2 − · · · − wi+1 − f) = 0,UNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES and then w − w1 − w2 − · · · − wi+1 = f + z, where z ∈ (0 :G cd−i)G. It follows that z ∈ I n−h d−i G ∩ (0 :G cd−i). By the uniform Artin-Rees property, there exists an integer h5 > h4, which depends only on the element cd−i, such that I n−h d−i G ∩ (0 :G cd−i) ⊆ I n−h d−i (0 :G cd−i). Thus z ∈ I n−h d−i (0 :G cd−i), for all n > h5. As Id−i−1 is a reduction of Id−i modulo (0 :R (0 :R cd−i)), there exists an integer h6, depending only on cd−i, such that I n d−i ⊆ I n−h d−i−1 + (0 :R (0 :R cd−i)), for all n > h6. Thus, by setting h equal to h5 + h6, we obtain I n−h d−i (0 :G cd−i)G ⊆ I n−h d−i− (0 :G cd−i)G ⊆ I n−h d−i−1G, which implies that f + z ∈ I n−h d−i−1G. As w − w1 − · · · − wi+1 ∈ N and w − w1 − · · · − wi+1 = f + z, we have w − w1 − · · · − wi+1 ∈ I n−h d−i−1G ∩ N. Thus, w ∈ I n−h d−i N + I n−h d−i−1G ∩ N as desired. We are finally ready to prove the theorem, from which the Main Theorem in the introduction follows as a corollary. (4.8) Theorem. Let (R, m, k) be a local ring of dimension d. There exists an integer h such that for all ideals I ⊆ R and for all short exact sequences of finitely generated modules 0 → A → B → M → 0 with M is a dth syzygy, I nB ∩ A ⊆ In−hA. Proof. If there exists such a bound for any faithfully flat extension of R then the same bound holds for R. Thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that R is complete and has an infinite residue field. We can reduce to the case that the middle module is free as follows. Let G be a free module mapping onto B and let N be the kernel of the composite map from G to M. Then G/N ∼= M and N maps to A (via the snake lemma). If w ∈ I nB ∩ A, then we may lift w to w1 ∈ InG. Since w maps to 0 in M, so does w1, i.e., w1 ∈ I nG ∩ N. So, if w1 ∈ In−hN then w ∈ In−hA. For the rest of the proof, we keep the notation that G is free and G/N ∼= M. Fix a KAS sequence c for the class of finitely generated dth syzygies of R, as given by Theorem 2.6. By 4.5, it is enough to find an integer h such that J nG ∩ N ⊆ Jn−hN for all ideals J that are special reductions of m-primary ideals with respect to the KAS sequence c. Let I = Id = (x1, . . . , xd) be a special reduction. Let k be the integer given by Proposition 4.7. By d applications of Proposition 4.7, I nG ∩ N ⊆ In−kN + (I n−k d−1 G ∩ N) ⊆ · · · ⊆ I n−kN + I n−2k d−1 N + · · · + I n−(d−1)k 2 N + I n−(d−1)k 1 G ∩ N ⊆ I n−dkN. Hence h = dk suffices. (4.9) Corollary. Let (R, m, k) be a local ring. Then every finitely generated module is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to every ideal in R. Proof. By Theorem 4.8, there exists an integer h such that if I is any ideal and if (F•, ∂•) is a free resolution of M, then I nFi ∩ ∂i+1(Fi+1) ⊆ In−h∂i+1(Fi+1) for i > d = dimR R. Once I is fixed, then there are also Artin-Rees numbers for the earlier syzygies, so the maximum of h and these numbers works for I and M. 14 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI A second corollary has to do with perturbations of resolutions. Let (R, m) be a local ring. A complex G′ • is a perturbation of G• to orders q1, q2, . . . if the free modules in each are the same and the difference of the nth differentials maps Gn to mqn Gn−1. Eisenbud and Huneke raise the following question (Question C in [6]): If G• is a minimal free resolution of the finitely generated module M, is there a number q such that any complex G′ • which is a perturbation of G• to order q, q, . . . is exact? (4.10) Corollary. Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d. Question C has an affirmative answer. Moreover, for the class of dth syzygy modules, the integer q may be chosen depending only on the ring. Proof. We refer the reader to Proposition 1.1 of [6] for details of how the syzygetic Artin-Rees property is connected to the perturbation question. References 1.

The adjacency matrix A(G) = (aij ) of G is the n × n matrix, where aij = 1 if viis adjacent to vj , and otherwise. ∗This work is supported by the Joint NSFC-ISF Research Program (jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Israel Science Foundation (No. E-mail: xiaodong@sjtu.edu.cn 1The problem of maximizing the number of edges over all graphs without containing fixed subgraphs is one of the cornerstones of graph theory. For example, if yk has a neighbour in W1, without loss of generality, say x1, then S 2≤i≤k−1 Qi together with a disjoint P3 with center yk and two ends u, z yield k · P3, a contradiction. If yk has a neighbour in W1, without loss of generality, say x1, then S 2≤i≤k−1 Qi together with zy1z1 and uykx1 will yield k · P3, where z is a neighbour of y1 in W\\W1. Since G is 2 · P3-free, G has exactly one connected component H of order p ≥ 3 and any of the remaining components (if any exists) is either an edge or an isolated vertex. 10If l = 4, then V (H)\\V (Q) is an independent set and all vertices in V (H)\\V (Q) are adjacent to precisely one of v2 and v3.

On the other hand, from Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, we see that if G is an F-free graph of order n, we determine the maximum number of edges and spectral radius of bipartite graphs which do not contain k · P3 as a subgraph and characterize all extremal graphs. Denote h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋ − 1 and suppose that G is an F-free graph of sufficiently large order n. (i) If there exists an even ai, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Sn,h) with equality if and only if G = Sn,h; (ii) If all ai are odd and there exists at least one ai > 3, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(S + n,h) with equality if and only if G = S + n,h.

      " variance as our final model and shall use it in the next section to simulate the IHF World Cup 2019. Odds 0.6688 0.8114 0.1256 - - 4 Prediction of the IHF World Cup Now we apply the best-performing model from Section 3, namely the regularized Gaussian response model with constant underdispersion, to the full World Cup 2011 – 2017 training data and will then use it to calculate winning probabilities for the World Cup 2019. It has to be stated that at the time this analysis has been performed, namely at the first tournament day (June 10, 2019) right before the start of the tournament, the teams of Bahrein and Sweden had listed squads consisting of 15 players only and there will probably be one more player moving up soon. Hence, for those two teams the covariates corresponding to natural-numbered team structure variables (such as, e.g., the number of legionnaires) have been normalized to be comparable to 16-player squads by multiplying them with the factor 16/15. Though the upper and lower half of the teams according to our calculated probabilities seem to coincide quite well with the overall ranking according to the bookmaker's odds, for single teams from the upper half, in particular, Denmark, Spain and Hungary, the differences between our approach and the bookmaker are substantial. While the model forecasts for example Spain and Croatia in Group B, Denmark and Norway in Group C and Hungary and Sweden in Group D with probabilities clearly larger than 90% to reach the second group stage, in Group A France followed by Germany are the main favorites, but with lower probabilities of 89.05% and 80.16%, respectively. 13Table 5: To account for the general increase of the gross domestic product (GDP) during 2011 – 2017, a ratio of the GDP per capita of the respective country and the worldwide average GDP per capita is used (source: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/ 2018/01/weodata/index.aspx). The points a team receives are determined from the final rankings of World Cups of the respective sub-groups and Olympic games and strictly increase over the years, so the ranking system displays an all-time ranking of the national federations. In this case, the scores of the competing teams are treated as (conditionally) independent variables following a Poisson distribution (conditioned on certain covariates), as introduced in the seminal works of Maher, 1982 and Dixon and Coles, 1997. The metric characteristics of both competing teams are captured in the p-dimensional vectors xik, x jk, while zik and zjk capture dummy variables for the categorical covariates Host, Nationality, Nationality as well as the two continental federation variables (built, for example, by reference encoding), separately for the considered teams and their respective opponents. If, as in our case, several covariates of the competing teams are included into the model it is sensible to use regularization techniques when estimating the models to allow for variable selection and to avoid overfitting. In contrast to the similar methodologies used in the past, such as Lasso, Lasso, Lasso, Lasso, Lasso, Lasso, Lasso, Lasso, Lasso does not only shrink parameters towards zero, but is able to set them to exactly zero. 73.3 Underdispersed Poisson model If we fit the (regularized) Poisson model from Section 3.1 to our IHF World Cup data and then estimate the dispersion parameter via equation (3), we obtain a value for φˆ clearly smaller than one (φˆ = 0.74), i.e. Note here that the main difference to the over- and underdispersion models from the two preceding sections is that there each observation obtains its own variance via Var Yi jk|xik, x jk= φˆ · λi jk, where in the Gaussian response model all observations have the same variance σˆ . We also want to point out here that in order to be able to simulate a precise match result from the model's distribution (and then, successively, to calculate probabilities for the three match results win, draw or loss), we have to apply the Poisson model to the full World Cup 2011 – 2017 training data and use it in the next section to simulate the IHF World Cup 2019. (2018) we use three different performance measures to compare the predictive power of the methods: • the multinomial likelihood, which for a single match outcome is defined as πˆ δ1 ˜yi 1i πˆ δ2 ˜yi 2i πˆ δ3 ˜yi 3i , with δ2 ˜yi 2i πˆ δ3 ˜yi 3i , with δ2 ˜yi 3i πˆ δ2 \n",

      "Introduction Denote by Ug,n the moduli space of reduced but otherwise arbitrarily singular, connected, proper curves of genus g with n marked points. It is known to be representable by an algebraic stack, locally of finite type over Spec Z with quasicompact and finite diagonal [Smy13, Appendix B]. The moduli space of all curves is not particularly \"nice:\" it is known to possess many irreducible components, due to existence of non-smoothable curve singularities of various genera [Mum75, Pin74]. It is also known to be highly non-separated, as evidenced by the many alternate compactifications of the moduli space of smooth pointed curves Mg,n [FS10, Bat22, Bat22, Bat22, BKN23]. We can view Terδ A~c,k as parametrizing families of curves normalized by Ce with conductor locus contained in Z. Crucially for our main result, Ishii has shown that the territories Ter g A + ~c,k are connected. We can see that Ter g A + ~c,k is represented by a k-point of Ter g A + ~c,k where all \"constants\" are equal. We can view Terδ A~c,k as parametrizing families of curves normalized by Ce with conductor locus contained in Z. Crucially for our main result, Ishii has shown that the territories Ter g A + ~c,k = {(fi(ti))i=1,...,m ∈ A~c,k | fi(0) = fj (0) for all i, j} of A~c,k where all \"constants\" are equal. (More geometrically, if ν : Ce → C is the normalization of a reduced curve, then a function on Ce can only descend to C if it is constant on the fibers of ν : Ce → C.) The codimension g of B in A + ~c,k is called the genus of the singularity, and it is equal to δ − (m − 1). We note A~c,k = A~c ⊗ k and A~c,k = A~c ⊗ k and A + ~c,k = A + ~c ⊗ k. The subalgebras of such algebras are parametrized by moduli schemes called territories, originally introduced by Ishii for k-algebras in the context of Noetherian k-schemes. (See [Ish80, Definition 1], [BGS24, Section 2]) Let S be a scheme and A a finite locally free sheaf of OS-algebras of rank n. Given an S-scheme f : T → S, a family of subalgebras of corank δ on T is a quasi-coherent OT -subalgebra B of f ∗A such that the quotient OT -module f ∗A /B is locally free of rank δ. We define a functor F δ A : (Sch/S) op → Set by: (i) If f : T → S is an S-scheme, F δ A (T → S) is the set of families of subalgebras of corank δ on T. (ii) If g : T → T ′ is a morphism of S-schemes, then F δ A (g) : F δ A (T ′ ) → F δ A (T ′ ) is defined by taking a family of subalgebras to its pullback.CONNECTEDNESS OF THE MODULI SPACE OF ALL REDUCED ALGEBRAIC CURVES Lemma 2.3. (See [Ish80, Theorem 1], [BGS24, Theorem 2.5]) Let S be a scheme and A a finite locally free sheaf of OS-algebras of rank n. The functor F δ A is represented by a closed S-subscheme Terδ A of Gr(n − δ, A ). In particular TerδA is locally projective over S. The reasoning at the beginning of this section implies that each isomorphism class of curve singularity over k is represented by a k-point of Terg A + ~c , where g is the family of subalgebras of Gr(n − δ, A ). In particular Terδ A is locally projective over S.

      "For example, it is a compactification of the moduli space of configurations of six points on the projective line (see [6, §2]) and its dual variety, called the Igusa quartic, is a compactification of the moduli space of certain abelian surfaces (see [13, Theorem 2]). We show that for every field of characteristic zero there is only one form of the Segre cubic over this field which is G-birationally rigid (see Definition 3.2), and only for the following groups: S6, A6, S5 and A5, where S6 is the full automorphism group and groups S5 and A5 are embedded into S6 in the standard way (see Definition 2.3). We denote the group of G-equivariant automorphisms of a G-variety X by AutG(X) and the group of G-equivariant birational selfmaps of a G-variety X by BirG(X). We denote the group of G-equivariant birational selfmaps of a G-variety X by BirG(X) and the group of G-equivariant birational selfmaps of a G-variety X by BirG(X). By Proposition 2.11 the group G is contained in the centralizer of the group H. Let F ⊂ S6 be a subgroup generated by G and H. If F does not contain a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6 then it is not hard to check directly with computer that the group F lies in one of the following subgroups: non-standard subgroup S5 ⊂ S6, non-standard subgroup S5 ⊂ S6, S 3 ⋊ C2 (which is the stabilizer of a point), S4 × C2 (which is the stabilizer of a plane on S) or S4 × C2 (which is conjugate to the following group: S4 acts by permutations of coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4 while C permutes x5 and x6 in standard coordinates; • the variety S contains exactly 15 planes which form an Aut(S)-orbit, one of them can be given by equations x1 + x2 = x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 = 0 in standard coordinates; • every singular point of S lies on 6 planes and every plane on S4 is conjugate to the following group: S4 acts by permutations of permutations of coordinates x1, x2, x3, x3, x4 while C permutes x5 and x6 in standard coordinates). The sum of all planes in the first orbit is not a integer multiple of a hyperplane section in C(X) and the sum of all planes in the second orbit is not a integer multiple of a hyperplane section in C(X) and the sum of 5 planes is not a integer multiple of a hyperplane section in C(X). Now we can apply a G-equivariant resolution of singularities and relative G-equivariant minimal model program and obtain a G-birational transformation into a G-Mori fibration with the base of positive dimension. The groups G and H are normal subgroups of F, all elements of G commute with all elements of H and they generate the whole group F. Obviously, it is possible only in the following case: one of the groups G and F coincides with F while the other one is trivial. If the group Pic(X) is embedded into Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/K) as a subgroup of index 2, so we define canonically an element of order 2 in the Brauer group Br(K). Since this element has a representation as a tensor product of 3quaternion algebras over the field K (see [12, Theorem 11.5]), there is a composite L of quadratic extensions of the field K such that our algebra splits over this extension. It is well-known (see, for example, [15, Chapter III, §1]) that there is a oneto-one correspondence between the forms of a real variety X and the elements of H (Gal(C/R), Aut(XC)). The form of the Segre cubic of type I can be obtained in the following way: blow up five R-points of P R in general position and contract proper transforms of lines passing through pairs of points. The forms of type IV and III can be constructed in a similar way, but we need to blow up P R in 3 real points and one pair of conjugated points or one real point and two pairs of conjugated points in general position respectively. One can easily see that we obtain exactly forms of type IV and III by calculation of numbers of singular Rpoints and planes defined over R in both cases. Theorem\n",

      "In [CKR11], Cernele, Kamgarpour, and Reichstein proved upper bounds in terms of p and n on the representation dimensions over the complex numbers C of groups of order p n for prime p. Similarly, Moret´o showed that the representation dimension over C of any finite group G, except for certain 2-groups, is at most p |G| [Mor21]. We say that an algebraic torus over k is irreducible if it does not properly contain a subtorus over k. Every algebraic torus T admits a matrix representation 12 B. HEATH via an embedding T ֒→ GLn for some positive integer n, and the representation dimension rdim (T) is the minimal n for which there exists a faithful embedding T ֒→ GLn. Lower bounds on rdim (n) for all positive integers n. Let p > 2 be prime, let Cp act on F p by shuffling coordinates, and let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p. Then, there are p− d + 1 irreducible Cp-stable subspaces of F p , one corresponding to each of the irreducible factors of x p − 1 in the polynomial ring F2 [x]. As the following result shows, binary vectors can be used to obtain upper bounds on G-lattices when G is a group of monomial matrices containing all diagonal matrices in GLn (Z). To prove (a), there are p− d + 1 irreducible Cp-stable subspaces of F p , one corresponding to each of the irreducible factors of x p − 1 in the polynomial ring F2 [x]. As the following result shows, binary vectors can be used to cook up nice generating sets for G-lattices when G is a group of monomial matrices containing all diagonal matrices in GLn (Z). To prove (a), it suffices to show that 2Z n ⊆ L. Since G contains a permutation matrix of degree n, this further reduces to showing that 2ei ∈ L for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where the ei's are the standard basis vectors for Z n . Although a bound on Na in Theorem 1.4 can be extracted from the proof of Theorem 5.22, this is not enough to prove that Theorem 1.4 implies that rdimirr (p) = 2pfor infinitely many primes p. For example, this would follow from the existence of some positive integer a such that there exist infinitely primes p for which the order of 2 modulo p is equal to p− a , but no such a is known. The symmetric rank statement follows from the fact that the G-orbit of v ∈ L is equal to the union of the orbits of v under the actions of the cosets of K in G. REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Note that any two Z-equivalent G-lattices have the same symmetric rank by (b) of Lemma 2.6, but Q-equivalent G-lattices need not have equal symmetric ranks. For all n ∈ Z +, we have rdim (n) = max (symrank (Z n , G)), where the maximum is taken over one representative G from each Z-conjugacy class of maximal (with respect to inclusion) finite subgroups of GLn (Z). Theorem 3.4, along with the overall ideas in this section, are very similar to work done by Lemire to obtain upper bounds on essential dimensions of certain linear algebraic groups [Lem04]. Using the Smith normal form, there exist P, Q ∈ GLn (Z) and an n × n integral diagonal matrix D such that P CQ = D. Note that the choices of P and Q are not canonical; our choices can be found in [Hea24, Appendix A]. Since Q ∈ GLn (Z), this is equivalent to the existence of some u ∈ Z n such that CQu = P −1Du = v. This equation provides conditions (via a system of linear equations) for determining the smallest (with respect to inclusion) W-sublattice of Λ containing a given v ∈ Λ. Therefore, if L ⊆ Λ is the smallest W-sublattice of Λ containing v, then the lattice spanned by W v must be L. We then use Lemma 3.3 and information about the Weyl groups of root systems (see, e.g.,\n",

      "We demonstrate that an arbitrary complex-valued linear transformation between an input and output FOV can be realized using spatially-engineered diffractive surfaces, where each feature (neuron) of a diffractive layer modulates the amplitude and/or phase of the optical wave field. Our results reveal that when the total number of engineered/optimized diffractive neurons of a material design exceeds 𝑁𝑖 × 𝑁𝑜, both the data-free and data-driven diffractive designs can all-optically approximate the target linear transformation with negligible error; here, 𝑁𝑖 and 𝑁𝑜 refer to the number of diffraction-limited, independent spots/pixels located within the area of the input and output FOVs. Our results confirm that, for a given total number of diffractive features/neurons (𝑁) available, building deeper diffractive networks where these neurons are distributed across multiple, successive layers, one following the other, can significantly improve the transformation error, output field accuracy and the diffraction efficiency of the whole system to all-optically implement an arbitrary, complex-valued target transformation between an input and output FOV. Compared to lens-based standard Fourier transform operations, diffractive surface-based solutions are not based on the paraxial approximation and offer a much more compact set-up (with a significantly smaller axial distance, e.g., < 50𝜆 , between the input-output planes) and do not suffer from aberrations, which is especially important for larger input/output FOVs. Although the target ground truth matrix (𝑷) for this case is real-valued and relatively simpler compared to that of e.g., the 2D Fourier transform operations, diffractive surface-based solutions are not based on the paraxial approximation and offer a much more compact set-up (with a significantly smaller axial distance, e.g., < 50𝜆 , between the input-output planes) and do not suffer from aberrations, which is especially important for larger input/output FOVs. Although the target ground truth matrix (𝑷) for this case is real-valued and relatively simpler compared to that of e.g., the 2D Fourier transform matrix, an all-optical permutation operation that preserves the phase and amplitude of each point is still rather unconventional and challenging to realize using standard optical components. Similar to the 2D discrete Fourier transform operation demonstrated earlier, diffractive surface-based solutions to high-pass filtered coherent imaging are not based on a low numerical aperture assumption or the paraxial approximation, and provide an axially compact implementation with a significantly smaller distance between the input and output FOV (e.g., < 50𝜆 ); furthermore, these diffractive designs can handle large input/output FOVs without suffering from aberrations. Since we are considering here passive diffractive layers only, the magnitude of the transmittance value of an optical neuron cannot be larger than one (i.e., |𝒕| ≤ 1), and therefore as the edge neurons in a data-free design start to get more transmissive to make up for the weaker input signals at their locations, the transmissivity of the central neurons of the diffractive layer become lower, balancing off their relative powers at the output FOV to be able to perform an arbitrary linear transformation. Regardless, by increasing the total number of neurons (𝑁 > 𝑁𝑖𝑁𝑜), the phase-only diffractive designs approach the all-optical transformation performance of their complex-valued counterparts designed by deep learning, while also providing a much better diffraction efficiency at the output FOV (see Supplementary Figs. Note also that, while the phase-only diffractive layers are individually lossless, the forward propagating optical fields still experience some power loss due to the opaque regions that are assumed to surround the diffractive surfaces (which is a design constraint as detailed in Section 2.1). Alternatively, one can also include such absorption- and reflection-related effects as well as mechanical misalignments (or fabrication imperfections) as part of the forward model of the optical system, which can be better taken into account during the deep learning-based optimization of the diffractive layers. Importantly, previous experimental studies28,29,32,34 reported on various diffractive network applications indicate that the impact of fabrication errors, reflection and absorption-based losses are indeed small and do not create a significant discrepancy between the predictions of the numerical forward models and the corresponding experimental measurements. The linear transformations that we used as our comparison testbeds are (i) arbitrarily generated complex-valued linear transformations, while also providing a much better diffraction efficiency at the input and output FOVs, while also providing a much better diffraction efficiency at the output FOV (see Supplementary Figs.

The task of computing correlation functions has therefore been reduced to computing the source and sink operators, OJ (t0; ˜i˜j ˜k) and OI(t; ˜i˜j ˜k) and OI(t; ˜i˜j ˜k) separately and then contracting the remaining dilution indices to form correlation functions. Simulation/Results 3.1 Parameters We have used the same configurations as in our earlier studies with the conventional, point-toall quark propagators (Ref. 3.2 Operators In this first test, we have focused on the nucleon G1g channel with one operator of each \"displacement type\" (apart from the single-site case where we have tried all three). Since the traditional method requires one to compute the correlation functions directly, we compare the number of quark inversions required for each computation as an indication of the cost of the simulation time. We note, however, that the construction of operators (correlation functions) consumes most of the simulation time when using all-to-all (point-to-all) propagators as defined in Ref. Juge 2.2 All-to-All Construction An expression for the nucleon propagator is increased by a factor of 4 to 576 = 3×Nσ ×Nt ≃ 7×84, when we dilute in spin as well as in time. We note, however, that the construction of operators (correlation functions) consumes most of the simulation time when using all-to-all (point-to-all) propagators for the heavy quark mass used here. Time-Spin-dilution The number of inversions in this scheme is increased by a factor of 4 to 576 = 3×Nσ ×Nt ≃ 7×84, when we dilute in spin as well as in time. On the other hand, the time-spin-dilution scheme shows error bars which are already compatible with the point-to-all effective masses on the same configurations. It is important to note that even though the cost of generating extra quark propagators is not compensated by a reduction in the error bars, the main purpose of using all-to-all propagators is to construct explicit multi-particle operators and correlation-functions on dynamical configurations, not just to reproduce the quenched spectra of source A and φe (d) [A] where ηe (d) [A] are the (smeared) diluted random noise sources for source A and φe (d) [A] are the corresponding (smeared) solutions (see Ref. The summation over the dilution set is no more than Ndil = NtNcNσ in this study and we take N = 1 (separately) for each of the three quark propagators.

      "(a) Control sequence for the phase imbalance in the auxiliary cavity and calculated input and output power normalized to the maximum intensity of the input pulse, assuming a Gaussian profile for the input pulse and no loss for all cavity modes except that due to the coupling to the input signal. (c) The same as in (a), except that losses of the cavity modes are taken into account by assuming γj = δj,04κ + 0.2κe−|j| + 0.01κ (see Supplementary Materials). To correct this distortion and restore the signal to its original shape for read-out, we tune φ to −π/2 and keep its value at −π/2 for the same amount of time tS for the same amount of time tS for which φ was set to π/2. 4 (a) and (b), after another period of time equal to the write-in time tS, we demonstrate that the OAM-based quantum memory can be read-out in the OAM-based quantum memory. We demonstrate that the OAM-based quantum memory has a few attractive characteristics and note-worthy advantages that are not available in existing schemes. Not only is the system very simple with just a single main cavity and thus completely realizable with conventional optical technology, but also the operating wavelength can be chosen at will, a significant edge in situations where no atomic systems with the desired transition frequency are available. We demonstrate this new designing principle by showing that two powerful devices, quantum memory and optical filter, can be realized utilizing photon OAM-based synthetic lattices. We can freeze the photon signal in the OAM lattice and enable its on-demand recall by slightly modifying our design from the device in Fig. 1. Once the input signal is absorbed into the cavity, we can stop the pulse's propagation and dispersion in the OAM lattice completely by adiabatically changing φ from 0 to π/2, which compresses the bandwidth to 0 because transitions between OAM modes via the two auxiliary cavities cancel each other. 5, the optical signal and its distribution in the OAM lattice can then be kept for an arbitrary and indefinite amount of time until it needs to be read-out by changing φ from π/2 to π. The storage fidelity of a single-photon pulse, which is defined as the wave-packet overlap between input and output conditional on the re-emission of a photon [25], is close to 1. Thus it is possible to realize perfect write-in, storage, and on-demand read-out of an optical signal using only a limited number of OAM states sufficient for the signal pulse to be absorbed into the cavity. In reality, all OAM modes are lossy due to factors such as intrinsic loss of the optical elements and leakage of l 6= 0 modes via the input-output pinhole. It is demonstrated that (see Supplementary Materials), our OAM-based quantum memory still functions as expected without wave-packet distortion in the presence of imperfections, though the efficiency is reduced, as shown in Figs. For the estimation of experimental parameters, we assume that the cavity is realized using four curved mirrors each with a focal length F on the order of centimeters, a typical value for discrete optical elements. The bandwidth can be further improved by using a smaller focal length F. The required modulation time for the phase imbalance φ is also on the order of tens of nanoseconds, consistent with the modulation speed of current electro-optic devices [13, 32]. As a comparison, the storage time of ideally identical coupled-micro-resonator based memory is limited below 0.1µs due to the large photon losses of the micro-resonators (about tens of MHz) [24]. One such example is high-density optical memory, which is defined as the wave-packet overlap of the micro-resonators (about tens of nanoseconds) [13, 32]. In addition, we can also realize the storage time of ideally identical coupled-micro-resonator based memory, which is defined as the storage time of ideally identical coupled-micro-resonator based memory, which is limited below 0.1µs due to the large photon losses of the micro-resonators (about tens of MHz) [24]. One such example is high-density optical memory, which is used in many fields such as quantum information [39–41], high-density wavelengthdivision-multiplexing networking, and optical signal processing [42–44]. If we choose the reflectivities of the coupling beam splitter and input/output pinhole appropriately such that ωm is very close to the cavity's band edge ωe = ω0 ± 2κ, the cavity changes from being totally reflective to being strongly absorptive to the incident light over a narrow frequency range |ωm − ωe|.\n",

      "With a view to apply the previous theory to the problem under consideration we leave the group G to act on any manifold ( the theorems proven here are slightly more general than it is strictly needed, in fact we allow G to act on any topological space) and we establish a few more facts. An elementary domain for the given action is an open subset E ⊂ E ⊂ M such that the following conditions are satisfied: (A) For any g1, g2 ∈ G, with g1 6= g2k, k ∈ K, Eg1 ∩ Eg2 = ∅, (B) S g∈G Eg = M. (2.26) Then we have the following result: (A) For any g1, g2 ∈ G, with g1 6= g2k, k ∈ K, Eg1 ∩ Eg2 = ∅, (B) S g∈G Eg = M. (2.25) Here bar means topological closure, and ∅ means the empty set. (2.26) Then we have the following result relating elementary domains for G and H : Proposition 6 ES is an elementary domain for H. 12Proof First note that condition (B) can be written EG = M. To verify condition (B) for H, we calculate, using (C), as follows. (2.27) we obtain h1 = h2k, where k ∈ H ∩ K = K.

The result is that for every pj ∶ X → Ω σ A S modulo Gpj ,κ(L ′ x) modulo Gpj ,κ(L ′ x) modulo Gpj ,κ(L ′ x) modulo Gpj ,κ(L ′ x ). We say that a topological semigroup S is A-generated if there is a mapping ϕ ∶ A → S such that ϕ(A) generates a dense subsemigroup of S. Consider a system of equations (2.1) with constraints Lx ⊆ A ∗ and wp ∈ Ω σ A S (x ∈ X and p ∈ P) where ui and vi are σ-terms in Ωσ X∪P S. A pseudovariety V is said to be weakly σ-reducible with respect to this system if in the case it has a solution modulo V, then there is a solution δ ∶ X ∪ P → ΩAS modulo V which satisfies the conditions ψV(δ(x)) ∈ Ω σ AV (x ∈ X). Since every p-group is a nilpotent group, if Gnil satisfies the pseudoidentity u = v, then for every prime number p, Gp satisfies the pseudoidentity u = v. The converse follows from fact that every finite nilpotent group is isomorphic to the direct product of its p-Sylow subgroups. For an A-generated pro-V semigroup S, we view S A both as a direct power of S and as the set of all functions from the set A to S. To each element w ∈ ΩAV, we may associate an A-ary operation wS ∶ S A, by the universal property of ΩAV, there is a unique extension ˆϕ ∶ ΩAV → S. Define wS(ϕ) = ϕˆ(w). The converse follows from fact that every finite nilpotent group is isomorphic to the direct product of its p-Sylow subgroups. For every p ∈ S, we see that every p ∈ OA(S) is a cofinite subset of P. For every p ∈ OA(S) is a cofinite subset of P. For every p ∈ OA(S), we see that every p ∈ OA(S) is a cofinite subset of P. For every p ∈ OA(S), we see that every p ∈ OA(S) is a cofinite subset of P. For every p ∈ OA(S) is a cofinite subset of P. For every p ∈ OA(S) is a cofinite subset of P. For every p ∈ OA(S) is a cofinite subset of P. For every p ∈ OA(S) is finite, S(H) is a cofinite subset of P. For every p ∈ S(H), we have ClGp,κ(H) ⊆ ClGp,κ(H) = K, hence, ClGp,κ(H) is a Gp-closed overgroup of H contained in K, by the choice of p, it follows that ClGp,κ(H) is a Gp-closed overgroup of H contained in K. The following two propositions are the main tools to show that the pseudovariety Gnil is σ-reducible. Since the pseudovariety Gp is weakly κ-reducible with respect to the systems of equations associated with finite directed graphs [21], by Theorem 2.5 we just need to show that Gp is σ-full. By definition of σ-full pseudovariety, it is enough to show that for a rational subset of A ∗ : (3.4) ψGp(Clσ(L)) ⊆ ClGp,κ(ψGp(L)),12 THE PSEUDOVARIETY OF ALL NILPOTENT GROUPS IS TAME (2.1), with constraints Lx ⊆ Lx ⊆ Lx ⊆ L �\n",

      "22.1 Gaussian ensembles with eigenvalues on R and C The three classical Gaussian Wigner-Dyson ensembles (the GOE, GUE and GSE) are defined as [13] Z GβE N = Z dH exp[−β Tr H /4] = cN,β Y N j= Z R dxj wβ(xj ) |∆N ({x})| β . (2.1) The random matrix elements Hkl are real, complex, or quaternion real numbers for β = 1, 2, 4. This makes it very plausible that the universality which is very well studied for real eigenvalues extends to the weakly non-Hermitian limit for all ensembles, beyond what is already known for β = 2. A much more challenging problem will be to show the universality of these kernels on C, either by going to non-Gaussian potentials of polynomial or harmonic form, or by considering non-Hermitian Wigner matrix ensembles, with elements being independent random variables. A further reason why we believe that this universality question is important is that some of the kernels on C reappear in the weakly non-Hermitian limit for all ensembles, beyond what is already known for β = 2. A much more challenging problem will be to show the universality of these kernels on C, either by going to non-Gaussian potentials of polynomial or harmonic form, or by considering non-Hermitian Wigner matrix ensembles, with elements being independent random variables. A further reason why we believe that this universality question is important is that some of the kernels on C reappear in the same integral form (with real arguments) when looking at symmetry transitions between two different Hermitian RMTs, say from one GUE to another GUE, in a corresponding \"weak\" limit. Acknowledgements: The organisers and participants of the workshop \"Random Matrix Theory and its Applications\" at MSRI Berkeley, 13th-17th September 2010, are thanked for many inspiring talks and discussions. These may be used to construct the kernels – which we will list for all the above matrix ensembles with complex eigenvalues. We will list for all the above matrix ensembles with complex eigenvalues – in terms of which all k-point correlation functions can be expressed, see eqs. We also highlight the relations between expectation values of characteristic polynomials on the one hand and (Nπ(1 − τ ))−1. 2.2 Limiting Airy kernels on R and C When appropriately zooming into the \"square root\" edge of the semi-circle, the three well-known Airy kernels (matrix-valued for β = 1, 4) are obtained for real eigenvalues. For complex eigenvalues we have to consider the vicinity of the eigenvalues on a thin ellipse which have the largest real parts, and where the weakly non-Hermitian limit introduced in [14] is defined such that σ = N √ 1 − τ (2.13) remains fixed (see Appendix B for the precise details of the scaling of the eigenvalues). In this limit the macroscopic support of the spectral density on an ellipse shrinks to the semi-circle distribution on the real axis, whereas microscopically we still have correlations of the eigenvalues in the complex plane. 2.4 Wishart-Laguerre ensembles with eigenvalues on R and C In order to be able to access the Bessel kernels for real and complex eigenvalues as well, we briefly introduce the Wishart-Laguerre (or chiral) ensembles (LβE) and their non-Hermitian counterparts (CLβE). In analogy to the Ginibre ensembles we define a parameter-dependent family of non-Hermitian Wishart-Laguerre (also called complex chiral) ensembles as the following two-matrix model Z CLβE N (τ ) = ZdW dV exp − 1 − τ Tr WW† + V †V − τ Tr WW† + V †V − τ (W V + V†W† ) , (2.29) with W and V † being two rectangular N × (N + ν) matrices. After mapping to Dirac eigenvalues λ = √ x, this becomes the same semi-circle distribution as for WD, but with eigenvalues coming in ±λ pairs, together with ν exactly zero eigenvalues making the origin special. The density of the complex Wishart eigenvalues on R and C In order to be able to access the Bessel kernels for real and complex eigenvalues as well, we briefly introduce the Wishart eigenvalues (\n",

The most direct and important criterion for the fast scrambling comes from ts ∼ log (N), where ts is defined as the timescale at which C(ts) reaches a saturated value (C(ts) ≃ 0.3 in our study [78]).We show that our numerical results in Fig. We also verify another necessary condition for fast scrambling, namely the initially built correlation is at most algebraically small (C ∼ N−γ) rather than exponential small in N [27, 28]. In the log-log scale, the linear fit demonstrates a power-law decay of C(t ∗ ) versus N. For the case of α ≠ 0.5, we find the fast scrambling is related to the time scale and is ambiguous at infinite temperature. That is, when the spin length S tends to infinite, the spin operator Sˆ can be replaced by the classical angular momentum vector S. Correspondingly, the commutator in the Heisenberg equation is replaced by the Poisson bracket. The lack of exponential growth in finite-size spin-1/2 systems may be further addressed by considering the models without conservation laws such as Floquet systems [70] with allto-all interactions. Then one can map the MPO to matrix product state (MPS) by vectorizing each local operator and employing the standard TDVP algorithm [75, 76] to evolve the MPS in time. In numerical simulations, we find that the bond dimension of the MPO χ = 100 is large enough to obtain the dynamics up to N = 48 sites within the truncation error 10−5 (2017).\n",

      "On a categorical structure of the set of all CFTs Rotem Ben Zeev, Behzat Ergun, Elisa Milan, and Shlomo S. Razamat∗ Department of Physics, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel (Dated: December 22, 2022) We identify a categorical structure of the set of all CFTs. In particular, we will discuss how one can understand more mathematically the set of all CFTs, either in a given dimension or in any dimension, as a ∗ rotemitbz@gmail.com, behzat.ergun@campus.technion.ac.il, elisa.milan90@gmail.com, and Shlomo S. Razamat@physics.technion.ac.il category. The main motivation for this note is to rewrite known facts about CFTs in the categorical language with the hope that this will lead eventually to deeper insights into the structure of the set of all CFTs. Another type of morphism that we will consider is taking a CFT and gauging part of its (generalized) global symmetry. This type of morphism is one that can be considered in the categorical language. The main motivation for this note is to rewrite known facts about CFTs in the categorical language with the hope that this will lead eventually to deeper insights into the structure of the set of all CFTs. Another type of morphism that we will consider is taking a CFT and gauging part of its (generalized) global symmetry.4 Finally, one, in principle, can also consider deforming a CFT by turning on vacuum expectation value (VEV) to an operator, but we will only discuss operator and gauging deformations in what follows. Naively we might be tempted to construct this morphism by searching for an appropriate deformation of one of the two types discussed above: deforming the CFT X, say, by an operator or gauging, leading to CFT Z. 5 These deformations are in a (possibly reducible) representation of the 0-form global symmetry group G (X) of the source CFT X. Namely, given a group element g ∈ G (X) 0 we have g · Oα = Og(α) , meaning that acting on the deformation of given scaling dimension, we obtain another deformation of the same scaling dimension. This is not the most general deformation: A general morphism is defined by a 4 The gauging, again, might depend on inessential continuous coupling constants or on consequential discrete parameters, such as the level of a Chern-Simons term in 3d. , (hnKngnHn, On)} = {(h1g1H1, O1), · · · , (hngnHn, On)} (6) where the last line follows since we have the relation Ki = giHig − i between the stabilizer subgroups of the deformations.9 The horizontal composition of two 2morphisms α1 and β1 is naturally defined as follows. By definition, all the exactly marginal deformations preserve GMc, but on an enhancement locus, where the symmetry is larger, various deformations might be again related to each other by the action of the enhanced global symmetry group. Here however, each 2-morphism is parametrized by a sequence of (equivalence classes of) group elements associated to loci where the two paths in question intersect a locus with enhanced global symmetry.14 Therefore, the source and target 1-morphisms might correspond to the same path or different paths which intersect at least at the same loci of enhanced symmetry (see Figure 4). A simple example is the N = 2 duality in D = 3 between a single chiral superfield and U(1) gauge theory with a single charge +1 chi of the eight doublets and form from them a mesonic operator and deform B by turning on a superpotential for this operator. [34] Zohar Komargodski, Shlomo S.Rhodegodski, Nf = 1 chi of the eight doublets and form from them a mesonic operator and deform B by turning on a superpotential for this operator. [35] Zohar Komargodski, Shlomo S.Rhodegodski, Shlomo S.Rhodegodski, Nf = 1 chi of the eight doublets and form from them a mesonic operator and deform B by turning on a superpotential for this operator. Note that from point of view of A we turned on a mass term and thus the theory E is SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 3 and additional free chiral fields [45]. Alternatively, we could first turn on the mass term which would lead to free CFT of 12 + 15 = 29 fields in the IR,\n",

Faltings [3] proved that the annihilator theorem holds for A if A has a dualizing complex or if A is a homomorphic image of a regular ring and that (2) always implies (1). The annihilator theorem holds for A if (C1) A is universally catenary; (C2) all the formal fibers of all the localizations of A are Cohen-Macaulay; and (C3) the Cohen-Macaulay locus of each finitely generated A-algebra is open. Indeed, Faltings [4] showed that A satisfies (C1)–(C3) whenever the annihilator theorem holds for any q ∈ Spec A \\ Y and p ∈ V (q)∩Z.

      "ophilic graphs Given the close similarity between Theorem 2 and Rubin's theorem above, it is natural to wonder how similar or different the notions of n-choosalbe and nmonophilic are. Then there are n n distinct ways to assign a color to each of a1, · · · , an, and each of them will preclude assigning a color to bk for some k. It follows that col(Kn,nn , L0) = 0. Let L ′ 0 be an n-list assignment for Kn,nn that is the same as L0 except that its colors are renamed so that colors 1, · · · , n do not appear in any of its lists. Let γ be a coloring of Hn+1 from L. Since col(Kn,nn , L0) = 0. Let L ′ 0 be an n-list assignment for Kn,nn that is the same as L0 except that its colors are renamed so that colors 1, · · · , n do not appear in any of its lists. Let γ be a coloring of Hn+1 from L. Since col(Kn,nn , L0) = 0, for each i, j ∈ [n], γ must assign color j to at least one vertex of Gi,j . On the other hand, col(Hn+1, n+ 1) ≥ n p : there are n p ways to color w1, · · · , wp from just [n]; then assign color n + 1 to every vi; and finally color every Gi,j using colors 1 and 2. We say two list assignments L and L ′ for a graph G are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by renaming colors and vertices, i.e., there is a bijection f : N → N and an automorphism φ : G → G such that for every vertex v ∈ G, L ′ (v) = f(L(φ(v))). Since Kn,nn is not colorable from L, there must exist some b ∈ B whose color list is exactly the n colors we have chosen for the vertices in A. If for some i 6= j, col(Kn,nn,1, L, v, i) = 0. Then, for each color that we choose to assign to v, there remains an (n − 1)-color list of choices for w, and an automorphism φ : G → G such that for every vertex v ∈ G, L ′ (v) = f(L(φ(v)) = f(L(φ(v))). Since Kn,nn is not colorable from L, there must exist some b ∈ B whose color list is exactly the same as L’s color list of choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L’s choices for L. Thus we get (2) Ak = (n − 1)Bk− By a similar (but slightly longer) reasoning, we see that (3) Bk = Ak−1 + (n − 2)Bk− Subtracting (3) from (2) gives (4) Ak − Bk = (−1)(Ak−1 − Bk−1) Now, by direct calculation, A1 = (n − 1)(n − 2), and B1 = (n − 2)2 + (n − 1). Then, in the proof of Lemma 2, the term col(G1, L, v1, c1)· col(G2, L, v2, c2) being subtracted in equation (1) is positive since each col(G1, L, v, c2)is now a path and n ≥ 3. Let L ′ d be an (n, n − 1)-list assignment for P obtained from Ld by removing one element other than c0 from Ld(w), and also one element from Ld(u) if |L(u)| = n. Since c0 ∈ L ′ d (w), L ′ d is not a type B list assignment for P. So, by Lemma 3, col(P, L′ d ) ≥ Bk−2 + 1 = Ak−2. Let Q be the path obtained by removing the edge vw (but not its vertices) from C. We will show there are at least two colorings of Q from L that extend to colorings of C. First, we need a definition. Note that although cycles are 2-monophilic, every even cycle has a minimizing 2-\n",

If any two objects are in the same cube, a probability of collision is computed assuming the space objects are two gas particles residing in the same cube for a duration of time equal to the integration step: pc,ij = |vi − vj |σi,j V ∆t (1) where pc,ij is the collision probability between objects i and j, viis the velocity of object i, σi,j is the cross-sectional collision area of the two objects, V is the volume of the cube, and ∆t is the integration time-step. The fragments resulting from a collision are generated according to NASA's SBM.5If one very large object is at risk of colliding with an even moderately small one, the variance is reduced by a factor ranging between 200 and 3,000; on average, a choice of kf = 102and kf = 1 lead to, respectively, a reduction factor of 387 and 425. On the other hand, deterministic initial conditions only marginally affect MOCAT-QD with kf = 10, 000, leading to an average variance reduction of 108: the implication is that in that case the largest source of uncertainty remains the collisions. MOCAT-QD with kf = 100 is likely the overall most efficient version, improving on the efficiency of MOCAT-MC by a factor of around 1,090 times when taking into account the increased compute time. We believe that the bias is likely caused by one, or both, of the following factors: 1) the PMD is not included in the probability of collision, and 2) the distribution of the total number of objects is non-Gaussian, and is actually quite heavy-tailed, because of the feedback loop where past collisions increase the probability of future collisions. First, it provides a theoretical justification for the choice of time-step and cube size of MOCAT-MC, which is a critical tuning problem that has been empirically studied in literature, but for which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no theoretical explanation has been provided. Second, the principal contribution of this paper is the introduction of MOCAT-QD, an all-vs-all simulator that provides high-fidelity, low variance solutions to the problem of simulating the long-term environment of LEO. Because the uncertainty on the standard deviation is multiplied by nσ when using MOCAT-MC, MOCAT-QD-VaR can be 3 times more efficient than the standard version of MOCAT-QD when seeking the 3σ VaR, leading to variance reduction factors of up to 4,300. However, likely because of the heavy-tailed distribution of all-vs-all simulators, MOCAT-QD-VaR can be 3 times more efficient when seeking the 3σ VaR, leading to variance reduction factors of up to 4,300. Note that as long as pc mp ≪ 1, the reduction in variance is approximately inversely proportional to mp; however, once pc mp approaches 1, which occurs when reaching the diagonal line splitting the figure, the overall variance tends to 0, dividing the original variance by a factor that tends to infinity. As an additional problem, since many more collisions occur, the number of generated objects can become excessively large in every simulation, increasing computational and memory requirements and leading to less effective outcomes than expected. Fragments Sampling We solve the above-mentioned problems in two steps: 1) instead of affecting the weights of the MC runs, we augment the debris fragments with a probability of existence equal to m− p , and 2) instead of propagating all debris, we randomly sample from them. Thus, for large simulations with many objects, and where many collisions happen, the latter approach might result in computational inefficiencies, and one may want to sample the existence of the parents after their probability of existence goes below a predefined threshold. Specifically, it is 9helpful to have mp,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v,v\n",

      "Introduction An outstanding problem in Diophantine approximation, motivated initially by Mahler's and Koksma's classifications of numbers, is to provide sharp estimates for the approximation of a real number by algebraic numbers of bounded degree. Starting with the pioneer work [Wi] of E. Wirsing in 1961, this problem has been studied by many authors and extended in several directions. For our purpose, let us simply mention that, in 1969, H. Davenport and W. M. Schmidt gave estimates for the approximation by algebraic integers [DS] and that, more recently, D. Roy and M. Waldschmidt looked at simultaneous approximations by several conjugate algebraic integers [RW]. While the latter work was limited to at most one quarter of the conjugates, we consider here the problem of simultaneous approximation of a real number by a polynomial of degree n+ 1. Upon defining the height H(P) of a polynomial P ∈ R[T] of degree n+ 1, and the height H(P) of a polynomial P ∈ R[T] of degree n+ 1, and the height H(P) of a polynomial P ∈ R[T] to be the largest absolute value of its coefficients, and the height H(α) of an algebraic number α ∈ C to be the height of its irreducible polynomial in Z[T], our main result reads as follows. (i) There are infinitely many algebraic numbers α of degree n such that (1) max α |ξ − α| ≤ c1H(Q) (2k−n)/n where the maximum is taken over all conjugates α of α. (ii) There are infinitely many algebraic integers α of degree n such that (1) max α |ξ − α| ≤ c1H(α) −2/n where the maximum is taken over all conjugates α of α. (ii) There are infinitely many algebraic integers α of degree n + 1 such that (2) max α6=α |ξ − α| ≤ c2H(α) −2/n where the maximum is taken over all conjugates α different from α. In fact, as we will see in the next section, the statement of part (i) is optimal up to the value of c1 for each ξ ∈ R\\Q, while the statement of part (ii) is optimal up to the value of c at least for quadratic irrational values of ξ. This seems to be the first instance where an optimal exponent of approximation is known for all values of the degree n in this type of problem. An irrational real number ξ is said to be badly approximable if there exists a constant c > 0 such that |ξ − p/q| ≥ cq−2for any rational number p/q. This is equivalent to asking that ξ has bounded partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion (see Theorem 5F in Chapter 1 of [Sc]). We first provide estimates for the last minimum of certain convex bodies of R[T]≤n with respect to Z[T]≤n and then deduce the existence of polynomials of Z[T]≤n with specific inhomogeneous Diophantine properties. If n ≥ 2, the result in part (i) of Theorem A is optimal up to the value of the implied constant since, for any algebraic number α of degree n with conjugates α1, . , αn, the discriminant D(α) of α satisfies |D(α)| ≤ H(α) 2(n−1) Y 1≤i<j≤n |αi − αj| 2 ≤ H(α) 2(n−1) Y 1≤i≤n |ξ − αi| n(n−1) Since D(α) is a non-zero integer, its absolute value is ≥ 1, and thus we deduce that max 1≤i≤n |ξ − αi| ≥ H(α) −2/n (compare with §5 of [Wi]). , αn+1, we have max1≤i≤n |ξ − αi| ≥ (1/2)H(α) −2/(n−1) .SIMULTANEOUS APPROXIMATION BY CONJUGATES OF AN ALGE\n",

But there is no contradiction here; the reason the Wootters decomposition works for all separable states is that it is based merely on minimizing average entanglement, a special kind of decomposition-state correlation, which means that at least for two qubits, all states with an MI set of decomposition states (Families 5 and 6 from Table I) are guaranteed to have a separable decomposition of only r members. (P2) Since statance ignores the decomposition probabilities, then regardless of what they are, we can only look at the decomposition states themselves, and here we notice that we can generate the same set from {ρ (1) , ρ (2) , ρ (3) , ρ (4) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (5) , ρ (6, and Theorem 7 seem to indicate to\n",

      "This key characteristic feature of quantum mechanics represents one of the most valuable resources at our disposal to break through the limits of classical computation and information processing, with various concrete applications e.g. Bell's proof of his famous theorem, as well as the subsequent formulation due to Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt [7], relies on the derivation of an inequality involving empirical probabilities, which must be satisfied by any local theory but is violated by quantum mechanics. In 1990, Mermin presented a simpler proof of this phenomenon, which rests on deriving an inconsistent system of equations in Z2, and became known in the literature as the original \"Allvs-Nothing\" (AvN) argument [11]. This new description of AvN arguments leads to another important result: • We prove that any AvN argument on an n-qubit stabiliser state can be reduced to an AvN argument only involving three qubits which are local to the qubits of the qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits of the Qubits as a Galois connection, which allows us to establish a relationship with the Galois connection between syntax and semantics in logic (see e.g. 1 By adopting the viewpoint of [10], this experiment can be seen as an empirical model whose support is partially described by Table 1 (the remaining choices of measurements give rows with full support and can therefore be ignored). In the examples considered here, we typically only present the rows corresponding to maximal contexts, as probabilities of outcomes for smaller contexts are determined from these by marginalisation – this corresponds to a compatibility condition which is a generalised form of no-signalling [10]. An empirical model e is strongly contextual if there is no global assignment g : X → O which is consistent with e in the sense that the restriction of g to each context U yields a joint outcome for that context which is possible (has non-zero probability) in e. Formally, there is no g : X → O such that, for all U ∈ U, eU (g|U ) > 0.

(b) Stabiliser subgroups induce XOR theories We are interested in a quantum measurement scenario where n parties share an n-qubit state and can each choose to perform a local Pauli operator X, Y , or Z on their respective qubit. Since the Galois connection is constructed through closed sets, it is tight in the sense of [24], and hence F is an order-isomorphism, with inverse G. This result suggests an intriguing relation with the Galois connection between syntax and semantics in logic [17, 25] L-Theories ←→ P(L-Structures) Γ 7−→ {M | ∀ϕ ∈ Γ.M |= ϕ} {ϕ | ∀M ∈ M.M |= ϕ} ←−[ M, (3.4) where L is a formal language. On the other hand, by (i), we have {ei , fi, gi} = {P, Q} with at least two elements equal to P. Thus, by (2.1), the product eifigi will be Q up to a phase, and so, as this is absorbed into the global phase, hi = Q. We will now prove the AvN triple conjecture for the case of maximal stabiliser subgroups, or equivalently, for stabiliser states, by taking advantage of the graph state formalism, which is a Galois connection between syntax and semantics in logic [17, 25] L-Theories ←→ P(L-Structures) Γ 7−→ {M | ∀ϕ ∈ Γ.M |= ϕ} {ϕ | ∀M ∈ M.M |= ϕ} ←−\n",

      "ra of VY Scl stars from those of dwarf novae in outburst, one may ask how the generally discussed X-ray emission regions in non-magnetic cataclysmic variables compare with the X-ray spectral characteristics of VY Scl stars. The matter at the inner edge of the accretion disk rotates with >∼1000 km/s (Keplerian) and will shear on to the surface of the slowly rotating white dwarf (assumed to rotate below its break-up rate) thus dissipating its kinetic energy in the so-called boundary layer. Depending on the accretion rate the boundary layer is expected to be either optically thin (at low M˙ ) or optically thin (at low M˙ )10 J. Greiner: Soft X-ray emission of VY Scl stars during optical high state with temperatures of ≈108 K (Pringle & Savonije 1979, Tylenda 1981) or to form an optically thick ring around the white dwarf equator (at high M˙ ) with temperatures of 200000–500000 K (Pringle 1977, Kley 1989). 3) during the optical high state with temperatures in the 3–5×106 K range and luminosities of 1031 − 1032 erg/s are distinctly different from those expected in the classical boundary layer picture in that the temperature is intermediate between the two types of boundary layer models and to form an optically thick ring around the white dwarf equator (at high M˙ ) with temperatures of 200000–500000 K (Pringle 1977, Kley 1989). 3) during the optical high state with temperatures in the 3–5×106 K range and luminosities of 1031 − 1032 erg/s are distinctly different from those expected in the classical boundary layer picture in that the temperature is intermediate between the two types of boundary layer models and the luminosity is lower than either type of model. Heavily absorbed classical boundary layer emission The UV observations with IUE over the last 2 decades have accumulated much evidence that high accretion rate cataclysmic variables possess strong stellar winds as revealed by the P Cygni profiles of UV resonance lines, predominantly CIV1549, NV1240 and SiIV1397. X-ray emission from an optically thick wind If, as explained in the previous section, the wind is completely optically thick for the boundary layer emission, one would only see the thermal emission from the wind itself (Mauche & Raymond 1987Hoare & Drew 1993) However, its size is expected to be much larger than the derived value of 50–120 m, and secondly its temperature is not expected to be considerably higher than that of the boundary layer, and therefore thermal emission from the wind is not a likely candidate for the observed 0.2–0.5 keV emission in VY Scl stars. Furthermore, two VY Scl stars (MV Lyr and V Cyg) have been observed with the ROSAT high-resolution imager (HRI) as targetofopportunity during times of op tical low states, and results of these observations are reported elsewhere (Greiner et al. Optical light curves of the 14 VY Scl stars over the last 7 years based on data from AAVSO, VSNET and AFOEV (scales are identical in all panels): crosses denote secure measurements while uncertain brightness estimates are marked by an open circle. (2) Dickey & Lockman (1990) Most of the data, especially of the well sampled objects, were either supplied by the AAVSO (courtesy J. Mattei; PX And, BH Lyn, DW UMa, LX Ser, MVLyr) or taken from VSNET (http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/; PX And, DW UMa, V Cyg). In some cases (PX And, BH Lyn and DW UMa) dense CCD observations during the end of 1996 were included in the otherwise visual brightness estimates obtained from AAVSO, and the faint phases of the eclipses of all these three objects have not been taken out, so that the apparent scatter is large. Spectral curves of the VY Scl stars over the last 7 years based on the VY Scl stars are expected to be in the optical high state with temperatures in the 3–5×106 K range and the apparent scatter is large. Spectral curves of the VY Scl stars over the last 7 years based on the optical high state with temperatures in the 3–5×106 K range and luminosities of the optical high state with temperatures in the 3–5×106 K range and luminosities of 1031 − 1032 erg/s are distinctly different from those expected in the classical boundary layer picture in that the optical high state with temperatures in the 3–5×106 K range and luminosities\n",

The set of distances ∆(H) is an interval with min ∆(H) = 1 ([21]) whose maximum is unknown in general ([22]) (this is in contrast to the fact that in finitely generated Krull monoids any finite set ∆ with min ∆ = gcd ∆ may occur as set of distances [18]). The standing conjecture is that the system of sets of lengths is characteristic for the group (see [15] for a survey, and [17, 23, 32, 31] for recent progress). This means that L(H) 6= L(H′) for all Krull monoids H′ having prime divisors in all classes and class group G′ not being isomorphic to G (here we need |G| ≥ 4). Answering a question of Narkiewicz, Kaczorowski gave the first purely arithmetical characterization of the class group ([24]), and we refer to [16, Chapter 7] for further information on such characterizations. The question, which sets of nonnegative integers are sets of lengths in all non-half-factorial transfer Krull monoids is completely answered. Now we consider numerical monoids, where by a numerical monoid, we mean an additive submonoid of (N0, +) whose complement in N0 is finite. Obviously, every nonzero element has a factorization into atoms and max L(a) ≤ a/n1 for all a ∈ H. Furthermore, we have {n1, n2} ⊂ L(n1n2) whence {(N − i)n1 + in2 | i ∈ [0, N]} ⊂ L(Nn1n2) for every N ∈ N . (2) Are there sets of lengths which are characteristic for a given numerical monoid (in the sense that they do not occur as a sets of lengths in any other numerical monoid) and are there sets of lengths which occur in any numerical monoid. The maximum of the set of distances is unknown (in terms of the atoms) and this question seems to have the same complexity as questions about the Frobenius number. In particular, it turns out these are not the same as questions about the Frobenius number.\n",

      "[1] developed a computational approach for determining under which parameter values Mixed Integer Linear Programming solutions remain optimal, but if multiple parameters change, it is necessary to solve a number of problems which is exponential in the number of changing parameter values. In this work, we consider combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), in which one selects a combination of elements from the ground set to minimize (maximize) some objective function based on the costs of the individual elements. Further relevant studies on sensitivity analysis for COPs can be found in [3, 11].In previous studies [4, 7, 8], we developed a theoretical framework called theory of tolerances, in which we determined the limits to the changes in the costs of elements or sets of elements such current solutions remain optimal and thus other solutions become optimal. As a consequence, if there is a set of elements in which all costs either increase or decrease, we need UT EP to determine whether the tolerance is defined, and we may discover that this is not the case. We further prove that several previous results, in particular exact values and upper and lower bounds, can be generalized for the new definitions so that the main part of the previous theory can be kept. In this work, we aim to provide new definitions of single and set tolerances, which • are consistent with the current definitions on their respective domains, • can be computed conveniently (i.e., previous computational results should be applicable to all elements/subsets). Combinatorial minimization problems In this section, we first show that several previous results, in particular exact values and upper and lower bounds, can be generalized for the new definitions so that the main part of the previous theory can be kept. In this work, we aim to provide new definitions of single and set tolerances, which • are consistent with the current definitions on their respective domains, • can be computed conveniently (i.e., previous computational results should be applicable to all elements/subsets). Combinatorial minimization problems Formally, a combinatorial minimization problem (CMP) P is given by a tuple (E, D, c, fc) where E is a finite ground set of elements, D ⊆ E \\ {∅} is the set of feasible solutions, c : E → R is the cost function which assigns costs to each single element of E, fc : D → R is a function which depends on the function c and assigns costs to each feasible solution D. 2S ∗ ⊆ E is called an optimal solution of P if S∗ is a feasible solution and the costs fc(S ∗ ) of S ∗ are infimum. We can determine the set UT EP from all single lower tolerances if fc is of type sum or product [4, Theorem 12] and from all so-called smallest includes if fc is of type bottleneck [12, Algorithm 1]. We can determine the set LT EP from all single upper tolerances if fc is of type sum or product [4, Theorem 6], but we need both all upper tolerances and smallest includes if fc is of type bottleneck [12, Algorithm 1]. We use the prime to distinguish the extended definitions and use the notation u ′ P (e) for single upper tolerances applied to the element e and the notation u ′ P (E) for single upper tolerances applied to the element e and the notation u ′ P (E) / ¯u ′ P (E) for regular / reverse set upper tolerances applied to the subset E. Lower tolerances For lower tolerances, we introduce new definitions, which for regular / reverse lower tolerances are as follows: l ′ P (E) := sup n α ∈ R ∃ ~α = (α1, α2, . For example, the upper tolerances of v, w, x, y in Example 2 are 0 under the current and the extended definition, whereas the upper tolerances of all elements v, w, x, y, z in Example 2 would be infinite under the new definition, as the objective value remains the same if the costs of each of these elements increased by any positive amount. A further benefit of the new definition of single lower tolerances is that it is consistent with the computation of lower tolerances of all elements both for the 1-Tree Problem in [6] (called nearness values) and for the Linear Assignment Problem [10] (called hard dual values). This element is included in the optimal solutions S1 and S2, so we should determine the infimum decrease in c(y) for each element in c(y) for which either S1 and S2 becomes 0 under the current definition of the new definition of single lower tolerances, and we find that the upper tolerances are consistent with the new definition of single lower tolerances. The new definition of single lower tolerances is consistent with the current definition of single lower tolerances is consistent with the\n",

      "Many recent results in characterizing entanglement follow the idea that entanglement is not changed by any local unitary transformation, and on average cannot be increased by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) [3, 4, 5], hereby called LOCC non-increasing principle. It is known that p copies of a bi-partite pure state ψ, whose von Neumann entropy of either party is E(ψ), can be transformed by reversible LOCC into pE(ψ) copies of EPR singlet states asymptotically, i.e. 1. For a multipartite system, how to characterize the nature of entanglement has remained quite open, with many interesting questions, for example, how many different kinds of entanglement there exist and how different entangled pure states are transformed into each other by reversible LOCC. For a given multipartite system, a set of different states is a RLEGS if a combination of these states, each entering with certain copies, can be transformed, under reversible LOCC, into certain copies of an arbitrary entangled pure state. For example E(i1)···(in)(⊗z|zi ⊗cz ) = cg(i1···in), (11) which, combined with the GRE subadditivity (5), leads to xg(i1···in) ≤ E(i1)···(in)(|ψi), (12) which represents N − 1 inequalities, each of which is between the relative number of copies of a GHZ-like state and a corresponding entanglement in |ψi. (10), one thus obtains inequalities for different entanglements in |ψi, which can be generally written as E(i1···ir)(ir+1···N)(|ψi) ≤ XE(j1)···(jl)(jl+1)···(jk)(|ψi), (13) for all 1 ≤ r ≤ N −1, where the summation is over all such entanglements for which (j1 · · · jl) is a subset of GP (i1 · · · jl) is a subset of GP (i1 · · ·ir) while (jl+1 · · · jk) is a subset of GP (ir+1 · · ·N). For this purpose, one could also reduce some inequalities concerning bi-GP entanglements not involving all the parties to equalities by setting these entanglements in |ψi to zero, and then look for a counterexample for which the system of equations of {xz} has no solutions, which would signal the frustration in those constraints on the relation between different entanglements. Summary To summarize, we sort out all entanglements in a N-partite system, where N ≥ 2. by associating an entanglement with each different set of GPs. For this combination, additivity holds for the GRE of each bi-GP entanglement and the GRE of true n-partite entanglements, 2 ≤ r ≤ N −1, where the summation is over all such entanglements for which (j1 · · · jl) is a subset of GP (i1 · · ·ir) while (jl+1 · · · jk) is a subset of GP (i1 · · · jk) is a subset of GP (ir+1 · · ·N). The generalized relative entropy of entanglement (GRE) defined for the entanglement among m GPs (11· · · n1 ), ( · · · n2), · · ·, and (m , · · · , mnm), with n1 + · · · + nm = n, is E ′ (ρ) = M inσT r(ρ ln ρ − ρ ln σ (αs) ks (2) where s denotes each different partition s, ks denotes the decomposition of density matrix under the partition s, ks denotes the decomposition of density matrix under the partition s, σ (αs) ks denotes the decomposition of density matrix under the partition s, σ (αs) ks is in the Hilbert space of αs and can be required to be pure. An entanglement not involving all the parties can be considered as a RLEGS. The generalized relative entropy of entanglement (GRE) defined for the entanglement among all the parties can be considered as E(i1 · · · n2), where σ (αs) ks is in the Hilbert space of αs and can be required to be pure. An entanglement not involving all the parties can be considered as a RLEGS. The generalized relative entropy of E(i1 · · · · · · N\n",

      "These two properties are considered indispensable as we observe that i) the empirical fastest estimators designed for the Shapley value or weighted Banzhaf values all follow the principle of maximum sample reuse and ii) amplifying scalars could deteriorate the convergence rates of estimators. Then, using the concept of (ϵ, δ)-approximation, i.e., P(∥ϕˆ − ϕ∥2 ≥ ϵ) ≤ δ where ϕ refers to some probabilistic value and ϕˆ is its estimate, we theoretically identify a formula from our framework that effectively determines the corresponding convergence rate, through which the sampling vector can be optimized. For the Shapley value, the previous best convergence rate is O(n(log n) ), achieved by the group testing estimator (Wang and Jia 2023a, Theorem 6); however, we note that in our experiments the previous best-performing estimator is the complement estimator (Zhang et al. If we fix the probability of sampling S to be the one, denoted by q ∈ R n, for the Shapley value, the previous best convergence rate is O(n(log n) ), achieved by the group testing estimator (Wang and Jia 2023a, Theorem 6); however, we note that in our experiments the previous best-performing estimator is the complement estimator (Zhang et al. If we fix the probability of sampling S to be the one, denoted by q ∈ R n, for the Shapley value, there is ϕi = E Shap S⊆[n]\\i ps+ qs+ (U(S ∪ i) − U(S)), (1) which is the weighted sampling lift (WSL) estimator employed by Kwon and Zou (2022a). If we switch the roles of p and q, the amplifying scalar could be as worst as Θ( n nk ) for small k. Meanwhile, we also notice that Kwon and Zou (2022b) resort to a one-for-all estimator based on ϕi = Xn s= ms · ER⊆[n]\\i r=s− [U(R ∪ i) − U(S)), (1) which is the weighted sampling lift (WSL) estimator employed by Kwon and Zou (2022a). If we switch the roles of p and q, the amplifying scalar could be as worst as Θ( n nk ) for small k. In the case of P2, we are able to establish a generic estimator that achieves the currently best convergence rate for the Shapley value by reducing the variance via the stratified sampling technique (Burgess and Chapman 2021; Castro et al. Empirical Evidence For convenience, we formally define the two aforementioned desirable properties for estimators to possess as P1: The underlying formula contains no amplifying scalars and P2: Each sampled subset is used to update all the estimates {ϕˆ i} n i=1. P1 refers to the property that the underlying formula does not contain any amplifying scalars for all probabilistic values in its scope, while P2 means whether each sampled subset is used to update all the estimates {ϕˆ i} n i=1. In Table 1, we summarize the previous estimators in terms of P1 and P2, and defer the technical details to Appendix D. Notably, the complement estimator is empirically the best for the Shapley value, while it is MSR for weighted Banzhaf values; both of them follow P1 and P2. All in all, we demonstrate that by sticking to the principle of maximum sample reuse and avoiding any amplifying scalars, we are able to establish a generic estimator that achieves the currently best convergence rate for any previously-studied semi-value. We use two types of utility functions for this end: i) following the experiment settings of (Li and Yu 2024), U(S) is set to be the cross-entropy of LeNets trained on S on the classification datasets FMNIST, MNIST and iris; to obtain the exact values, the number of training data n is set to be 24; ii) U is defined to be the sum of unanimity (SOU) games, i.e., U(S) = Pd j=1 αj1Sj⊆S where each ∅ ⊊ Sj ⊊ [n] is randomly sampled, for which each semi-value can be computed by ϕi = Pd j=1 αj1Sj⊆S where each ∅ ⊊ Sj ⊊ [n] is randomly sampled, for which each semi-value can be computed by ϕi = Pd j=1\n",

      ", §14, Theorems 4 and 5]. Any non-division quaternion F-algebra is isomorphic to the F-algebra of two-by-two matrices over F. Hence all such F-algebras are isometric and contain every quadratic field extension of F. Therefore our linkage properties are only of interest for division algebras. Hence the results of Section 5 directly give constructions of totally linked division quaternion F-algebras that are not isomorphic, totally separably linked but not inseparably linked quaternion algebras, and so on.TOTAL LINKAGE OF QUATERNION ALGEBRAS AND PFISTER FORMS IN CHARACTERISTIC TWO In [17], it is shown that the construction of totally linked non-isomorphic division quaternion algebras can be naturally reinterpreted as questions on whether a pair of quaternion algebras can be naturally reinterpreted as questions on whether a pair of 2-fold Pfister forms become hyperbolic over a common quadratic extension of F. In [17], it is shown that the construction of totally linked non-isomorphic division quaternion algebras from [8] can be adapted to give examples of fields of characteristic different from 2 over which there are infinitely many non-isomorphic totally linked division quaternion algebras. In this article, for any integer n > 1, we show how to construct n-fold Pfister forms over fields of characteristic 2 that are not isometric but become hyperbolic over all the same quadratic extensions of the base field. This shows in particular that the linkage result from [15] does not have a natural analogue if we consider Pfister forms becoming hyperbolic over all quadratic subfields of a certain type. We show that there exist fields with this property such that there are 2-fold Pfister forms defined on them that become hyperbolic over all the same quadratic subfields, yet still fail to be isometric. However, we also show that for global fields and fields of characteristic 2 over which there are 2-fold Pfister forms are determined by the separable quadratic extensions that they become hyperbolic over. Then we write ρK = (V ⊗F K, qK) such that ρFk+1is hyperbolic, then either ρ is hyperbolic or ρ is hyperbolic over all quadratic subfields of a certain type of F. We also show that ρ is hyperbolic over Fk by [14, (1.4)]. We also show that for 1-fold Pfister forms in characteristic 2 over which there are 2-fold Pfister forms are determined by the separable quadratic extensions that they become hyperbolic over F. If there exists an element c ∈ F with c < ℘(F) such that for L = K(α), where α 2 + α = c, we have that πL and π ′ L are hyperbolic, then π ≃ π ′ .TOTAL LINKAGE OF QUATERNION ALGEBRAS AND PFISTER FORMS IN CHARACTERISTIC TWO Proof. Note that the argument in Theorem 6.8 requires that the separable extension linking the two 2-fold Pfister forms π and π ′ over K = F((t)) to be defined over F. In general, this condition cannot be weakened to linkage questions are trivial, as it easily follows from Lemmas 3.1 and 2.1 that every anisotropic 1-fold Pfister form π is determined up to isometry by the unique separable quadratic extension of K, then they are not necessary isometric in general. In fact it easily follows from Propositions 6.6 and 6.7 that there is a one-to-one correspondence between separable quadratic extensions of a perfect field and isomorphism classes of quaternion algebras over the field of Laurent series over the same perfect field. This result is well-known to experts, but as no proof appears in the literature as yet, we give a proof in characteristic 2 that shows that totally separably linked 2-fold Pfister forms are hyperbolic, there exists some m > 0 such that dim(ρm) , 0 and dim(ρi) = 0 for all i > m. In particular, the form ρm is even dimensional and becomes hyperbolic over its own function field, and hence is similar to a Pfister form by [5, (23.4)]. In fact, the Pfister forms in Example 5.9 share no common quadratic extension of the base field over which they become hyperbolic, which is a much stronger property than needed to satisfy the hypotheses of the\n",

      "Inspired by the seminal work of Morris and Starr in 1974 (Morris and Starr, The Structure of All-Interval Series 1974), it expands their analysis using complex network theory and provides composers and theorists with the re-ordering scheme that links all AISs together by chains of relations. Although all-interval 12-tone series (AIS) have been used in atonal music as early as the 1920's (A. Berg's Lyric Suite is an example), it took more than 40 years before their categorization and cataloguing. While Nicolas Slonimsky listed 18 \"invertible dodecaphonic progressions with all different intervals\" in his Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns (Slonimsky 1947), we owe Bauer-Mangelberg and Ferentz (Bauer-Mengelberg and Ferentz 1965) the first attempt to the generation of AIS using a computer program to explore all the combinatorial possibilities that give rise to such chords. In particular, they state that: \"It is possible that some […] re-ordering scheme could, possibly in conjunction with other operations, link all AISs together by chains of relations, which would be an elegant description of the generation of AISs and would doubtless provide interesting compositional devices for pitch-ordering.\" (Morris and Starr, The Structure of All-Interval Series 1974) The above observation is the main motivation for this work: after introducing the computational tools used in our study, they state that: \"It is possible that some […] re-ordering scheme could, possibly in conjunction with other operations, link all AISs together by chains of relations, which would be an elegant description of the generation of AISs and would doubtless provide interesting compositional devices for pitchordering.\" (Morris and Starr, The Structure of All-Interval Series 1974) The above observation is the main motivation for this work: after introducing the computational tools used in our study, we indeed show that the \"re-ordering\" scheme envisioned by Morris and Starr exists in the form of complex networks and discuss the insight that can be gained by such representation. Note that since the computation of the LISV exploits the cyclic property of the row, we need to end the interval series with a tritone, and then remove from the list all the rows that have cardinality less than 12. Among the computational tools developed for this project (the IPython notebook with all the code to generate the results of this study will be made available as an on-line supplement to this paper), we have also written a helper class to seamlessly operate on the rows with the four closed symmetry operations of inversion (I), retrograde (R), element-wise multiplication of the series by 5, mod-12 (M) and the cyclic permutation of stride w (Q), where w is chosen so that the result is again an AIS in normal form (the results of Q and R need to be transposed to make them in normal form). Once we purge the list of all the rows that are related to each other by the four operations, we obtain the set of 918 prime form row generators, which we report in Table I and that will be analyzed in the remaining of this paper. In Table 1 each prime form AIS is labelled with a sequential number (an extension of the Forte classification scheme (Forte 1973) for pitch class sets), and particular suffixes (S, P or L) are used to indicate some peculiar combinatorial property of the row discussed below. In particular, following Elliott Carter (Carter 2002), we identified 57 symmetrical inverted (non-retrogradable) and 34 parallel inverted AIS, labeled in Table 1 with the S and P suffixes, respectively.1 Finally, the suffix L indicates the existence of an AIS that can be used in conjunction with any other AIS that has cardinality less than 12. In addition, we have identified a subset of AIS that can be used in conjunction with any other AIS that can be used in conjunction with any other AIS that can be used in conjunction with any other AIS that can be used in conjunction with any other AIS that can be used in conjunction with any other AIS.\n",

      "The second one is the imperfect orientation of the LC molecules near the vicinity of resonators and PI films although strong magnetic field is applied. At this point, we have investigated the magnetic tunability of LC-based all-dielectric metamaterial by changing the orientation of the LC molecules from isotropic state to an anisotropic one. As for practical applications, better tunability can be obtained by changing the orientation from an anisotropic state to another anisotropic one. For example, as for magnetic resonance, a maximum tunability of 0.006 THz (from 0.674 THz to 0.668 THz) can be observed when the direction of external magnetic field changes from z direction to y direction. We also calculate the absolute transmission modulation in such case, where a maximum absolute transmission modulation of 20% is achieved at 0.674 THz. As for the electric resonance, a maximum tunability of 0.033 THz (from 0.814 THz to 0.781 THz) can be observed when the direction of external magnetic field changes from z direction to y direction. A tuning figure of merit (FOM) is introduced to quantify the resonance switching, which is given by: tuning range (THz) FOM FWHM (THz)  (1) Here, FWHM is the full width at half maximum of the resonance. As for the electric resonance, a maximum tunability of 0.033 THz (from 0.814 THz to 0.781 THz) is obtained when the direction of external magnetic field changes from y direction to x direction. A tuning figure of merit (FOM) is introduced to quantify the resonance switching, which is given by: tuning range (THz) FOM FWHM (THz)  (1) Here, FWHM is the full width at half maximum of the resonance. In conclusion, a magnetically tunable all-dielectric metamaterials in THz range based on liquid crystal (LC) has been proposed and demonstrated. This work provides a promising way for tunable all-dielectric metamaterial, which would find considerable application in THz range.Funding This work is supported by the 111 project(NO.B17007)and Director Funds of Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence.

      "It only uses statistical analysis of PDB data to predict the positions of the peptide plane O and side chain Cβ atoms from the knowledge of the Cα atom positions: Once the Cα coordinates of an amino acid are given, a search algorithm fits it with a PDB structure and identifies the ensuing O and Cβ atom coordinates as the reconstructed coordinates. These coordinates depict how a miniature Frenet frame observer, standing at the position of the i th Cα atom and head towards the north pole of S α (i), sees the backbone twisting and bending when she proceeds along the chain to the position of the (i + 1)st Cα atom. 7: Color online: Statistical distribution of all Cα atoms in our 1.0 A pool of PDB structures, on stereographically ˚ projected sphere shown in Figure 6.

The PDB structure, on stereographically ˚ projected sphere shown in Figure 6. The PDB structure, on stereographically ˚ projected sphere shown in Figure 6. The PDB structure, on stereographically ˚ projected sphere shown in Figure 6. The PDB structure is concentrated inside an annulus, with inner circle κin ≈ 1 and outer circle κout ≈ π/2. We proceed to describe how we predict the positions of the O and Cβ atoms from the knowledge of the Cα atoms coordinates, along a given (dynamical) protein structure: We first use the torsion angle τ ∈ [−π,π) to divide the statistical distribution of Figure 7 into 60 equal size sectors sized ∆τ = π/30 radians. We then divide each of these sectors into two sets, one with bond angle κ < 1.2 (rad) and the other with κ ≥ 1.2 (rad); we choose this value since the circle κ = 1.2 divides the annulus in Figure 7 roughly into annuli of α-helix-like and β-strand-like (secondary) structures. Our reconstruction algorithm is extremely simple and proceeds very fast computationally, much faster than any of the other three reconstruction programs we consider, even though we have not optimized the search algorithm but use a straightforward MatLab code. The reason why we divide the original annulus into two using κ = 1.2 in our search algorithm is, that while a torsion angle is determined by four Cα atoms, in the case of a bond angle only three Cα are needed; see Figure 2. Direction comparison In order to compare the different reconstruction methods we introduce two unit length vectors −−−−→ CαO and −−−−→Cαβ ; the former points from the Cα atom to the following peptide plane O atom (X = O in the sequel), and the latter points from the Cα atom to its side chain Cβ atom (X = β in the sequel). For each of the k = 1.2 and k = 1.2 of the K = 1.2 of the K = 1.2 of the K = 1.2 of the K,K Anton chain structure, we evaluate the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the angles Θ y X [i,k] by summing over the N individual residues of the chain, RMS [Θ y X (k)] = vut N X N i= Θ y X [i,k] (12) The distribution density (12) then measures the overall accuracy of a method, in the reconstruction of the CαO-Cβ chains. For reference, in Figure 8 we present the combined distribution of the Debye-Waller fluctuation distances p < |x| 2 > = r B 8π for the O and Cβ atoms, that we have evaluated using the B-factors in our 1.0 A PDB pool; note the logarith- ˚ mic scale. 8: Color online: Combined B-factor fluctuation distances for the O and Cβ atoms Similarly, Figure 9 shows the statistical distributions in the individual Cα-O and Cα-Cβ distances that we calculate directly from the coordinates in our PDB data pool and Anton data, respectively; only results for villin are shown as the results for ww-domain are very similar. We observe that both Pulchra and Remo distributions are slightly wider than the PDB distribution, we propose that this reflects mainly the presence of thermal effects in the PDB distribution, we propose that this reflects mainly the presence of thermal effects in the Anton data, we propose that this reflects mainly the presence of thermal effects in the Anton data, in the reconstruction of the CαO-Cβ chains.\n",

Cette propriété garantit en particulier que les lettres 0 et 1 sont uniformément distribuées par rapport à une mesure de probabilité ν sur {0, ..., n − 1}, w[i + k] = u[k]; in the particular case i = u[k]; in the particular case i = u[k], w[i + k] = u[n − 1], where u[k] denotes the (k + 1)-th letter of u, is a factor of length n of a (finite or infinite) word w if there exists a nonnegative integer i such that for all k ∈ {0, ..., n − 1}, w[i + k] = u[k]; in the particular case i = 0, we say that u is the prefix of length n of w, and denote it by u = pn(w). As much as we can, we refer to the elements of AR∗ or ARN as \"sequences\" instead of \"words\"; nonetheless, some tools like the notions of factor and prefix will turn out to be useful for this second alphabet as well. D'un point de vue géométrique, cela signifie que les points PN := PN n=0 ew[n] , où (e0, e1) désigne la base canonique de R , restent à une distance bornée de la droite portée par le vecteur fréquence (ν(0), ν(1)). The sequence of infinite words (un · vn)n∈N ∈ (AN)N converges to w. If (sn)n∈N ∈ ARN is a sequence containing infinitely many occurrences of each Arnoux-Rauzy substitution σ1, σ2 and σ3, then the sequence of finite words (s0 ◦...◦sn−1(α)), with α ∈ A, converges to an infinite word w0 which does not depend on α. This definition of Arnoux-Rauzy words is equivalent to the more usual one: an infinite word is an Arnoux-Rauzy word if it has complexity 2n + 1 and admits exactly one right and one left special factor of each length. When the vector of letter frequencies exists, as it is the case for any Arnoux-Rauzy word, it is natural to study the difference between the predicted frequencies of letters and their observed occurrences. Denote by Mp the incidence matrix of the substitution associated with p (following Remark 1), which is a product of the Arnoux-Rauzy matrices Mσ1, Mσ and Mσ3, and thus belongs to GL3(Z). If for all d ∈ Z 3∩∆0, where ∆0 denotes the plane of R3 with equation x + y + z = 0, there exist u and v ∈ F(w) such that ab(u) − ab(v) = d, then, for any plane Π and for any D ∈ R +, there exists k ∈ N such that the euclidean distance between the point ab(pk(w)) and the plane Π is larger than D. Proof. We obtain, by applying Proposition 2 to the word w∞ described in Proposition 1 and to planes spanned by fw and a vector of ∆0, that the Rauzy fractal associated with w∞ cannot be trapped between two parallels lines.

      "Further, we will identify when there are arcs that may give rise to inequivalent generalized crossing changes, and prove the following corollary.4 Kai Ishihara and Matt Rathbun Corollary 1.3 Any GOF-knot K has at most two equivalence classes of generalized crossing changes which produce another GOF-knot. In Section 3 we will discuss monodromies giving rise to clean or once-unclean arcs and we will identify the manifolds in which the relevant GOF-knots sit, and classify generalized crossing changes between GOF-knots, proving Corollary 1.2 and Theorem 1.1.5 Kai Ishihara and Matt Rathbun Corollary 1.6 Kai Ishihara and Matt Rathbun Corollary 1.7 Kai Ishihara and Matt Rathbun Theorem 3. This surgery corresponds to the operation of cutting the fiber bundle along F× {∗} and gluing it again after twisting n-times along c. Then the resulting manifold is a new once-punctured torus bundle, whose monodromy is changed by D n c from the original one, where Dc is a Dehn twist along c. We will use this method multiple times to give surgery descriptions of GOF(0; k, `) in M(0; k, `) and GOF(±1; m) in M(±1; m). Then the resulting manifold is a new once-punctured torus bundle, whose monodromy is changed by D n c from the original one, where Dc is a Dehn twist along c. We will use this method multiple times to give surgery descriptions of GOF(0; k, `) in M(0; k, `) and GOF(±1; m) in M(±1; m). Since a (generalized) crossing change taking one GOF-knot to another must be around a crossing circle bounding a disk that intersects the fiber in an arc, the crossing change is a Dehn surgery along the curve formed by the union of the arc and its image. In Case (1), the frontier of N1 consists of one closed loop (bounding a disk in F), and whose vertices span a simplex if the vertices correspond to isotopy classes of arcs that can be made pairwise disjoint (on their interiors) in F. Suppose F is a once-punctured torus. Then by Alexander's Trick, an automorphism h of F is determined up to free isotopy by the images of α and β under h. Further, an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of F, which can be identified with an element of SL(2, Z), induces an automorphism of A(F), an automorphism of T , and an orientation-preserving isometry of H2 which extends to a continous map of H , agreeing with the actions on A(F) and T . Also, χ(K) refers to the maximal Euler characteristic of all Seifert surfaces for K, and a Seifert surface S for K is said to be taut if its Euler characteristic realizes χ(K).10 Kai Ishihara and Matt Rathbun Lemma 3.1 If K is a GOF-knot with fiber F, L is a crossing circle for K, and the result of an order q generalized crossing change (q-twist) along L is another GOFknot, then L bounds a disk that intersects F in a single arc α. But then they both realize χ(K) = χ(K ), so, in particular, S must be taut for K. There are no Euler characteristic −1 surfaces in a once-punctured torus bundle besides the fiber, so S = F, and the first part of the statement is established. Now, in exactly the same way as obtaining Theorem 5 from Theorem 3 in [7], we have that if a crossing disk intersects a fiber surface in an arc, and the result of the generalized crossing change is another fiber bundle, then one of the two cases in the statement of the lemma occurs, or the arc is clean and non-alternating. Lemma 3.3 If κ is a GOF-knot with fiber V ∈ A(F) is said to be visible from A if v is adjacent in A(F) to a vertex on the opposite side of A. Coward and Lackenby showed that if L is another GOF-knot, L bounds a disk that intersects F in a single arc α. There are no Euler characteristic −1 surfaces in a once-punctured torus bundle besides the fiber, so S must be taut for K. There are no Euler characteristic −1 surfaces in a once-punctured torus,\n",

      "Perfect graphs have formed a central field in graph theory for some decades, partly because of the challenging open problems and partly because of the connections to polyhedral combinatorics, linear optimisation and computational complexity, see for example [RAR01]. We introduce a family of concentrated distributions L(n) which are used in the generation process, and give a number of results essential for our analysis, including surveying relevant results about random partitions, but we defer the detailed proofs concerning the generation process to § 9 near the end of the paper. The approximate sampling, Gen(n), is a convenient method for estimating probability, because it decomposes the resulting graph into three independent parts – a central clique, a partition of the remaining vertices and a bipartite part in between. However, sometimes there is a phase transition when the central clique becomes bigger than the remaining graph, most notably when we look at Hamiltonian cycles in co-unipolar graphs, and then we take x ∈ C \\Q in a different side independent set, since |C \\Q| > (1−3ǫ) n 4 ≥ |I|; and the path u, x, w connects u to C. The proof of Theorem 2.5 is rather technical, and we just seen that all vertices in C are connected to w. We have now shown that PGen(n)(κ(G) = δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G) + δ(G)) = 1 − e −Ω(n) , and Theorem 2.3 completes the proof. Pick an edge e incident with v0, use for example the algorithm of [MG92] to ∆(G)-edge-colour G\\e, and then use a standard Vizing fan iteration to colour e.) Let dj = dj (G) be the jth largest degree in the list of all v(G) degrees. Let (G, C) be the highest degree in the list of all v(G) degrees. Let (G+, C) be the unipolar arrangement induced by the generation of Gen+(n), and let B denote the corresponding bipartite graph with parts C and C. With high probability, d(u) ≥ (1 − ǫ) n for all u in C, and d(v) ≤ (1 + ǫ) n for all v in C. Hence, by Lemma 7.3, whp d1(G +) − d2(G+) = d1(B) − d2(B) ≥ n 1/ 2 log n , and so whp G+ has a unique vertex of maximum degree. 8 The limit of a sequence of random perfect graphs We show that a sequence of uniformly and independently sampled n-vertex perfect graphs converges with probability one to the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graphon the graph, we just test if some vertex in B is non-adjacent to at least one vertex in each side clique; and similarly for the second case. There are several other subclasses of perfect graphs for which the clique-chromatic number is known to be at most 3, and it was conjectured in [DSSW91] that perfect graphs have bounded cliquechromatic number. We shall see in the next two lemmas that, for G+ ∼ Gen+(n), whp the big side cliques can all be seen by some x ∈ C and the small side cliques are not maximal, so we can apply the above deterministic lemma to deduce that whp G+ is 2-clique-colourable.

Note that a is a three dimensional subalgebra of d, we further deduce that α = γ = 0 and β = 24 (m2 − 1). 5 Further discussion on the algebraic set V (r) To create a two-dimensional subalgebra of d, it suffices to give a quadruple (n, k, r, a), where n, k ∈ N with n > k, r ∈ Γ(n, k), and a ∈ V (r) ×. It is easy to observe that V (r) is an algebraic set solely depending on r. However, for an arbitrary r ∈ Γ(n, k), a concrete parametrization for all points of V (r) is not known. Nonetheless, we can describe all points of V (r) × in a few special cases and estimate the cardinality of the set V (r) × for an arbitrary r ∈ Γ(n, k), and a ∈ V (r) ×. It is easy to observe that V (r) is an algebraic set solely depending on r. However, for an arbitrary r ∈ Γ(n, k), a concrete parametrization for all points of V (r) is not known. Nonetheless, we can describe all points of V (r) × in a few special cases and estimate the cardinality of the set V (r) × for an arbitrary r ∈ Γ(n, k). Hence, if a = spanC{F(t)∂, G(t) ∈ C[t ± ], then [X, Y ] = cY is equivalent to t(F(t)G ′ (t) − G(t)F ′ (t)) = cG(t), (1.1) where F ′ (t) and G′(t) are the formal derivatives of F(t) and G(t), respectively. Therefore, our problem that aims to find all two-dimensional subalgebras of d is reduced to find all solutions of the differential equation (1.1) in C[t ± ]. One might use the theory of differential equations to solve (1.1), then to obtain all solutions of the differential equation (1.1) in C[t ± ]. Note that the Jacobian matrix of the defining equations in (2.2) is J(x) = (irjx i− j ) 16i6n− 16j6n Evaluating at a ∈ V (r) ×, its sub-matrix consisting of the first n − 1 columns has the determinant (n − 1)!   nY− j= rj   ·   Y 16i6=j6n− (ai − aj ) ⊕ d+, nor contained in d0 ⊕ d−. In order to describe the new family of two-dimensional subalgebras of d, we first introduce the following notation: (i) Give n, k ∈ N with n > k, we define the set Γ(n, k) := (r1, . (2.4) Then the two-dimensional subspace s(µ) := spanC{Pµ(t)∂, Qµ(t)∂} ⊆ d, (2.5) is a Lie subalgebra of d. Indeed, Pµ(t)∂ satisfy [Pµ(t)∂, Qµ(t)∂] = cµQµ(t)∂, (2.6) where cµ = (−1)n+1|r|a1 · · · an. In order to prove ai 6= aj for i 6= j, it suffices to show that there are exactly n distinct equivalence classes. 53 Classification of two-dimensional subalgebras of d In this section, we focus on proving that every two-dimensional subalgebra of d is exactly equal to one of those given in Section 2. Since a is a two-dimensional subalgebra of d, there is a basis {X, Y } of s such that [X, Y ] = cY, for some non-zero c ∈ C. Note that {X −αY, Y } is also a basis of a satisfying [Pµ(t)∂]\n",

      "Setting Qd = H3/PSL(2, Od) to be the Bianchi orbifold, it is well-known that Qd is a finite volume hyperbolic orbifold with hd cusps (see [MR03] Chapters 8 and 9 for example). A non-compact finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold X is called arithmetic if X and Qd are commensurable, that is to say they share a common finite sheeted cover (see [MR03] Chapter 8 for more on this). In an email to the first and third authors in 2009, W. Thurston asked the following question about principal congruence link complements: \"Although there are infinitely many arithmetic link complements, there are only finitely many that come from principal congruence subgroups. Some of the examples known seem to be among the most general (given their volume) for producing lots of exceptional manifolds by Dehn and O'Brien, and using a combination of the techniques described in §2, all remaining cases were eliminated except for the 8 pairs (d, I) stated in Theorem 1.2, and (2,h1 + 3√ −2i). In Table 1 we provide some additional information associated to the 8 cases to be identified as link groups. In contrast to the other cases, this final case required finding an automatic structure for a certain group for which we used the program Monoid Automata Factory (MAF) [Wil17]. In the light of this, we have decided to present the work here essentially in \"announcement form\", deferring the technical details including the Magma routines and SnapPy computations of homology for congruence manifolds to the technical report [BGR18] (for example see §14 of [BGR18] which summarizes the Magma calculations). In contrast to the other cases, this final case required finding an automatic structure for a certain group for which we used the program Monoid Automata Factory (MAF) [Wil17]. In the light of this, we have decided to present the work here essentially in \"announcement form\", deferring the technical details including the Magma routines and SnapPy computations of homology for congruence manifolds to the technical report [BGR18] (for example see §14 of [BGR18] (for example see §14 of [BGR18] which summarizes the Magma calculations). In particular, a complete proof of Theorem 1.2 (and Theorem 1.1) can be obtained in two ways from [BGR18]: by combining Section 3 of [BGR18] with either Part 1 (the work of the second author) or Part 2 (the work of the first and third authors) of [BGR18]. In addition they also wishALL PRINCIPAL CONGRUENCE LINK GROUPS to thank several people without whose help we would not have been able to complete this work: M. D. E. Conder, D. Holt, E. A. O'Brien, A. It can then be easily checked that there are only 6 pairs (d, I), up to complex conjugation with d as above, so that Γ(I) contains a non-trivial element of finite order. Moreover, when the class number is 1, all ideals are principal and the argument above bounds the absolute value of a generator of the ideal, and when the class number is greater than 1, this bounds the absolute value of some x ∈ I. Summarizing this discussion we obtain (see [BR14, Section 4.1] and [BR17, Lemma 4.1]): Theorem 2.2. Theorem 2.2 reduces the classification of which principal congruence groups are link groups to a finite list, indeed there are 302 cases (up to complex conjugation and excluding the 6 cases that give groups containing elements of finite order).4 M. D. BAKER, M. GOERNER, AND A. W. REID 2.2.

      "The formulation Shelah prefers is the following: 0.1a Theorem: cf ([ℵω] ℵ , ⊆) < ℵω This formulations says that the cofinality of the partial ordering of set inclusion over countable subsets of ℵω is ALWAYS smaller than ℵω4, no matter how large ℵ ℵ ω may be. One corollary is that the structure of embeddability over the class we shall study — which is defined by imposing restrictions on the the graph's end-structure — is not independent of negations of GCH, but is independent of negations of GCH. The theory of universal graphs, that began with Rado's construction [R] of a countable strongly universal graph, has advanced considerably since, especially in studying universality over monotone classes (see [DHV] for motivation for this). A good source for the development of this theory is the survey paper [KP1], in which the authors suggest a generalization of universality, which they name \"complexity\": the complexity of a class of graphs is the least number of members in the class needed to embed as induced subgraphs all members in the class. In Section 1 a class of graphs is specified by forbidding countable configurations related to the graph's end-structure, and second, we fix a mapping r so that r(v) = ∅ for v ∈ G in case there are no rays in G[v] and r(v) is a ray in G[v] otherwise. The following set is closed unbounded in λ by a standard back and forth argument: (6) E = {α < λ : G α 2 ∩ G α 2 ∩ G1 = G α } Therefore, by the definition of I, the set N(E) = {δ ∈ S : cδ ⊆ E} satisfies (7) S \\ N(E) ∈ I We shall show that for every δ ∈ N(E) we have for all v ∈ G1 such that r1(v) 6= ∅: (8) ϕ<1,r1(v, δ) = ϕ<2,r2(v, δ) Let v ∈ G1 be given. Enumerate Aδ = hXδ,α : α < λi for δ ∈ S. By induction on α < λ we define an increasing and continuous union of graphs Gα such that: (a) |Gα| < λ (b) β < α < λ implies that Gβ is an induced subgraph of Gα and if α is a limit ordinal then Gα = S β<α Gβ. The second is that also it says something stronger than setting a lower bound for complexity: it says that for every set of fewer than 2ℵ members in Gµ there is a smaller graph G ∈ Gλ for some regular λ < µ. Generalization to higher cardinals We state now the most general form of representation we know for G. This involves replacing club guessing using cδ-s of order type ω with club guessing using cδ-s of order type λ, for some µ of cofinality ℵ0. Replacing ω and P(ω) with µ and [µ] ℵ0 respectively in the proof of Theorem 1.10, there is only one difficulty: in establishing condition (d) in the proof, the argument that cδ ⊆∗ E implies that ϕ<1,r(v, δ) = ϕ<2,r(v, δ) breaks down, because a proper initial segment of cδ is almost (=except for a proper initial segment) contained in E for some club E. This recent result of Gitik and Shelah asserts that for all regular uncountable cardinals λ > ℵ1, every normal ideal over λ is a λ-complete ideal over λ and idb(C¯) is a λ-complete ideal over λ and idb(C¯) is a λ-complete ideal over λ and idb(C¯) is a λ-complete ideal over λ and idb(C¯) is a λ-complete ideal over λ and idb(C¯) is normal. Kojman: embeddability §1 Representing embeddability as set inclusion In [K] it is proved: 1.1 Theorem: If G is a class of graphs that is closed unbounded by a standard back and forth argument: (1) E is a homogeneity property: modulo I, all rays in the class are closed unbounded in λ, and\n",

      "Amplitude encoding allows for a systematic exploration of what ends up being a fairly small ansatz space, as well as recycling the four-loop amplitude in D-dimensional box-cuts for all-multiplicity at any higher-loop order. The tree-level BCJ representations appearing in the literature [3, 4, 17–29] have satisfied, in addition, at most one of the two other virtues, although they may have other very favorable features such as explicit locality in external momenta, arising naturally from string-theory, compactness, or explicit forms for all multiplicity. If we can additionally impose symmetry, we will find that the representation needs only a single function: all the half-ladders at any given multiplicity will be mapped to kinematic factors with the very same function, but with permuted arguments – rendering the double-copy constructed gravity amplitudes manifestly permutation symmetric. (3.10) We can, however, find that the representation needs only a single function: the representation needs only a single function: all the half-ladders at any given multiplicity will be mapped to kinematic factors with the very same function, but with permuted arguments – rendering the double-copy constructed gravity amplitudes manifestly permutation symmetric. BACKGROUND A. Cubic representation and correspondence between color and kinematics The correspondence between color and kinematics relies [5, 15, 32] on the ability to write any m-point L-loop, amplitude, with all particles in the adjoint representation, as (−i) L g m−2+2L YM A L m = X g∈graphs Z Y L i= d Dqi (2π)D S(g) n(g)c(g) Q l∈p(g) l , (2.1) where gYM is the coupling constant. (2.3) In the early eighties, two papers looking at general gauge theories explored a \"radiation zero\" discovered a few years earlier in an electroweak four-point process [33]; the relations they found were later recognized as the four-point expression of a more general color-kinematics correspondence [3]. While the general form of the identities is somewhat involved, the structure and the occurrence of kinematic coefficients in the relations can be seen in the following five-point example: s24s245A tree (1, 2, 4, 5, 3) = −A tree (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4)s14(s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14 + s14. We can reduce this linear system by simple elimination of kinematic factors, solving each in terms of simple linear combinations of others, until no more elimination is possible, and we are left with a solution for every kinematic factor as a linear functional of the graphs independent under these relations. Recall that many of these graphs may share the same topology – in fact, the master graphs can all be chosen to be various labelings of the half-ladder4– as we will do for the rest of this discussion. There is but one kinematic Jacobi relation between these graphs, and following the signs of the color factors associated with this edge ordering, it is nu = ns − nt, in correspondence with the color Jacobi relation cu = cs − ct. We can write down any (4−3)! In order to find the correct form of n(a, b, c, d) we need to solve the following functional constraints: n(a, b, c, d) we need to solve the following functional constraints: n(a, b, c, d) = n(a, b, c, d) + n(b, c, d, a) (3.5) A tree (a, b, c, d) = n(a, b, c, d) + n(b, c, d, a) sbc (3.6) n(a, b, c, d) = n(c, d, a, b) (3.7) = −n(a, b, d, c) = −n(b, a, c, d), 5where the first relation is the Jacobi relation\n",

The underlying graph of S(N) is the production graph of N (Definition 4.10), which may be larger than the underlying graph of N. For each a ∈ A the processor Pa of S(N) has state space Qa = {0, 1, . The next lemma shows that any strong amplifier gives an upper bound.18 BENJAMIN BOND AND LIONEL LEVINE Recall the least action principle [BL13, Lemma 4.3], which says that if w is a legal execution for x.r and w is a complete execution for x.r, then |w| ≤ |w |. In this case Lemma 6. implies that if for a particular input x.r there is a legal execution in which each vertex v processes at least Lvvyv letters, then Topp(L) does not halt on input x.r. When G is undirected (or Eulerian directed) we can take y = 1 and we recover the criterion of Tardos [Tar88, Lemma 4.3]: if two input words to Pv are permutations of one another, then for each outgoing edge (v, u) the resulting messages passed to Pu must be permutations of one another. The total state of an abelian network N = (Pv)v∈V is described by an element q ∈ Q := Q v∈V Qv giving the internal states of the processors, together with a vector x ∈ Z A where A = tv∈V Av indicating how many letters of each type are waiting to be processed. Each πa has three effects: change the internal state qv to taqv, where v is the unique vertex such that a ∈ Av; decrement xa by one; and increment each coordinate xb by the number of letters b passed (as specified by the message passing function T(v,u) where b ∈ Au). The least action principle [BL13, Lemma 4.3] says that if w is any legal execution for x.q and w is any complete execution for x.q, then |w|a ≤ |w |a for all a ∈ A, where |w|a is the number of letters a in the word w. A consequence of particular importance in this paper is the following. (Halting Dichotomy, [BL13, Lemma 4.4]) For a given initial state q and input x to an abelian network N, either (1) There does not exist a finite complete execution for x.q; orABELIAN NETWORKS (2) Every legal execution for x.q is finite, and any two complete legal executions w, w for x.q satisfy |w| = |w |. We associate two algebraic objects to an abelian network, the total kernel K and production matrix P. Only P figures in our criterion for halting on all inputs, but we will see that K is the natural domain of P considered as a Z-linear map. Indeed the succession rules studied in that paper can be modeled by an abelian network (i.e., those satisfying Qv = evQv for all v ∈ V ). Let us point out that the definition (7) of a metered action makes sense for arbitrary monoids M and M , which allows us to define networks with coefficients in an arbitrary monoid C. Are there interesting examples with C noncommutative?

We associate two algebraic objects to an abelian network, the total kernel K and production matrix P. Only P figures in our criterion for halting on all inputs, but we will see that K is the natural domain of P considered as a Z-linear map. In words, a strong amplifier is a strong amplifier is a pair x.q with the property that after processing all letters once, the network has returned to the same state q with at least as long as pab := limn→∞ n pab(n) if this limit exists. The irreducible components Pα of P are the irreducible components Pα of P are the automata with alphabet A and state space Qα, where Q = tQα is the partition of Qα is the partition of Q into equivalence classes under the relation q ∼ q if there exist m, m0 ∈ M such that mq = m0q (see Lemma 2.1).

      "A subset C of V is said to be strongly connected if, for any two vertices x, y of C there is a directed path of Γ from x to y with all vertices contained in C. The digraph Γ is said to be strongly connected if V is strongly connected. It was proved independently by Mader [14] and Watkins [18] that the connectivity of a strongly connected vertex-transitive symmetric digraph with degree d is greater than 2d/3. It was proved by Watkins in [18] that the connectivity of a strongly connected edge-transitive graph is its minimal degree. A digraph Γ with degree d is said to be superconnected if every cutset with cardinality less than d + 1 consists of all successors or all predecessors of some vertex. This notion, introduced in the undirected case, by Boesch and Tindell [3], was also investigated among others by Fiol [5] and Balbuena and Carmona [1]. susana@ma4.upc.edu 1If any cutset T with |T| ≤ d and |T| 6= |V | − 3, creates exactly two strongly connected components one of them consists of a single vertex, the digraph Γ will be called vosperian. As observed by Meng in [16], vosperianity is basically equivalent to the notion of hyper-connectdness, introduced independently in the undirected case, by Boesch [2]. susana@ma4.upc.edu 1If any cutset T with |T| ≤ d and |T| 6= |V | − 3, creates exactly two strongly connected components one of them consists of a single vertex, the digraph Γ will be called vosperian. As observed by Meng in [16], vosperianity is basically equivalent to the notion of hyper-connectdness, introduced independently in the undirected case, by Boesch [2]. In the last paper it is shown that a strongly connected irreducible anti-symmetric arc-transitive digraph is either vosperian or bistar superconnected. More recently, the authors of [11] have given necessary and sufficient conditions for an undirected vertex-transitive graph to be vosperian. An automorphism of Γ is a bijection f : V → V such that f(Γ(x)) = Γ(f(x)), for every x ∈ V. A digraph is said to be vertex-transitive if, for any pair x, y of vertices, there is an automorphism that maps x into y. A set S of a group G is said to be left-periodic if for some x ∈ G \\ {1}, xS = S. If both S and S −1 are not left-periodic, we shall say that S is aperiodic. The next lemma is just an exercise: Lemma 1 Let S be a subset of a group G. Then (i) Cay(G, S) = (G, E) has a pair of twins if and only if S is left-periodic, (ii) Cay(G, S) = (G, E) is irreducible if and only if S is aperiodic. (1) The digraph Γ is said to be k-separable if there is a subset X ⊂ V such that min{|X|, |∇(X)|} ≥ k. We shall say that a subset X of V induces a k-separation on Γ if k ≤ min{|X|, |∇(X)|} < ∞. We need a special case k = 2 of the easy next lemma: Lemma B (folklore) Let Γ = (V, E) be a finite k-separable digraph and let A be a k-atom with |A| > k. Then Γ −(x) ∩ A 6= ∅, for every x ∈ A. Recall the following result: Lemma E (folklore) Let G be a finite group and let S be a subset of G. Any block B of Γ = Cay(G, S) with 1 ∈ B is a subgroup of G. As an easy exercise, the reader may show that a digraph Γ is vosperian if and only if it is vosperian if and only if we need a special case k. We need a special case k = 2 of the easy next lemma: Lemma B.\n",

Indeed, he has proven that for any infinite set S, there is a unique minimal finite subset S0 of S so that any positive-definite integral quadratic form represents all numbers in S if it represents the numbers in S0. While working on the 15-Theorem, Conway and Schneeberger were led to conjecture that every integer-valued quadratic form that represents the positive integers between 1 and 290 must be universal. If we set CQ = X d|N Xs i= X e| d cond χ |cd,i,e| √ e , we have |aC(n)| ≤ CQd(n) √ n. This implies that there is a constant F so that if F4(n) := √ n d(n) Y p∤N,p|n χD(p)=− p − p + > F, then n is represented by Q. If we set CQ = X d|N Xs i= X e| d cond χ |cd,i,e| √ e , we have |aC(n)| ≤ CQd(n) √ n. This implies that there is a constant F so that if F4(n) := √ n d(n) Y p∤N,p|n χD(p)=− p − p + > F, then n is represented by Q. There are a total of 395007 squarefree n coprime to 3 for which F(n) ≤ F. The form Q′(x, y, z, w) = w 2 + 2x2 + 14y2 + 78z is the quadratic form corresponding to a sublattice of L. We make an array of the values represented by T(x, y, z) = 2x 2 + 14y2 + 78z2 with 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 800 and z ≤ 278. Of the 395007 squarefree n coprime to 3 with F(n) ≤ F, at most 9 are not represented by Q′, and Q represents all positive integers coprime to 3 except 19, 22, 31, 35, 37, 38, 46, 47, 55, 58, 62, 70, 94, 110, 119, 145, 203, 290, then it represents all positive integers coprime to 3. We say that the discriminant of Q is the quadratic form Q′(x, y, z, w) = w 2 + 2x2 + 14y2 + 78z is the quadratic form corresponding to a sublattice of L. This means that the new subspace of S2(Γ0(N), χ) is the entire space, and that any cusp form C(z) in this space has a decomposition C(z) = a b c d ∈ SL2(Z) : N|c . If Q = ~xTA~x, we say that A is the Gram matrix of L. We will move freely between a quadratic form and its corresponding lattice, and use adjectives that apply to quadratic forms to refer to lattices and vice versa. We say that a positive-definite form Q locally represents an integer m if m > 0 and for all primes p, there is some ~x ∈ Z r p so that Q(~x) = m. If Q is fixed, we let Gen(Q) denote the finite collection of positive-definite integral forms R so that R is equivalent to Q over Zp for all primes p. By work of Siegel [15], we have that X∞ n= aE(n)q n = P R∈Gen(Q) θR(z)/#Aut(R) P R∈Gen(Q) 1/#Aut(R) = X∞ n=0 Y p≤∞ βp(n) ! q n ,6 JUSTIN DEBENEDETTO AND JEREMY ROUSE where βp(n) is the local density associated to p, Q and n. It follows from this formula that if |Gen(Q)| = 1, then Q represents every integer n that is locally represented by Q.

      "Advances in Artificial Intelligence Require Progress Across all of Computer Science February Gregory D. Hager, Randal Bryant, Eric Horvitz, Maja Matarić, and Vasant Honavar Over the last decade, the constellation of computing technologies referred to as artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged into the public view as an important frontier of technological innovation with potential influences in many realms. Although AI will be an engine for progress in many areas (e.g., automated vehicles, robots, software assistants, in realworld environments) there is an increasing need for research on frameworks, languages, abstraction, and interfaces that allow effective communication and interaction between humans and AI systems. AI systems must engage with humans in a collaborative manner, allowing people to work interactively with AI systems (e.g., interactive machine learning), that help with the specification, encoding, and understanding of the implications of different policies, values, and preferences assumed by automated systems, and supporting new kinds of human-AI collaboration, including mixed-initiative interaction and augmenting human cognition. At the same time, such systems will also become far more present and consequential to everyday life, and will provide services and capabilities that will exploit large amounts of data (including personal data), and provide new kinds of human-AI collaboration, including new kinds of human-AI collaboration, including mixed-initiative interaction and augmenting human cognition. At the same time, such systems will also become far more present and consequential to everyday life, and will provide services and capabilities that will exploit large amounts of data (including personal data), control physical devices of various kinds, including devices in safety critical areas, and be empowered to make and act on decisions of varying importance that could influence individuals and societies in explicit and implicit ways. The path toward a balanced portfolio of capable, safe, and transparent AI-based systems will draw on a broad spectrum of computing ideas and principles, and is likely to become a driver for new advances in computing. There are continuing opportunities for the formal study of hard challenges in AI with tools and techniques developed in the realms of analysis of algorithms, including efforts in combinatorics, computational complexity theory, and studies of computability. Directions include understanding and hardening systems to whole new categories of attack including, \"machine learning attacks,\" where clever adversarial procedures are employed to inject data into systems that will confuse or bias them in their intended operation. Higher-level languages can offer engineers and scientists new kinds of abstractions and power to weave together multiple competencies, such as a vision, speech recognition, and natural language understanding so as to be able to develop and debug programs that rely on the close coordination of multiple AI analytical pipelines. Efforts include methods for explaining the results of AI systems to people, allowing people to work interactively with AI systems (e.g., interactive machine learning), that help with the specification, encoding, and understanding of the implications of different policies, values, and preferences assumed by automated systems, and supporting new kinds of human-AI collaboration, including mixed-initiative interaction and augmenting human cognition. Computing Systems and Hardware Research in computer hardware, operating systems, and computer networking have been, and continue to be, critical to creating the large-scale systems, including AI systems that use vast amounts of data to build predictive models, optimize complex objective functions, perform automated inference over large knowledge bases, or complex probability distributions. Some of the largest computer facilities in the world are operated by industrial and government organizations to collect data, build predictive models from data using machine learning algorithms, and then use the resulting predictive models to provide services ranging from driving directions to shopping recommendations. At scale, it may become cost and energy efficient to include even more customized capability that must be shared among one to a million users depending on the system in question. For example, machine learning, which lies at the heart of many modern AI systems, enables Google's AlphaGo program to devise strategies for playing the game of Go by analyzing large data sets of transactions and then suggest products to customers; automobile lane tracking systems to detect lane markers from video images and warn drivers when they are veering out of their lanes; language translation systems to detect lane markers from video images and warn drivers when they are veering out of their lanes; language translation systems to generate mappings from one language to data using machine learning algorithms, and then use the resulting predictive models to provide services ranging from driving directions to shopping recommendations. However, as we approach the end of the Moore's law, performance gains that are required for successful deployment of AI systems in real-world applications are likely to require innovations in hardware and systems as well as co-design of hardware and software to exploit the special features of specialized architectures and systems. At scale, it may become cost and energy efficient to include even more customized capability that must be shared among one to a million users depending on the system in question.

Given the root system Φ of a finite reflection group, one classically looks for a subset ∆ that is a simple system, namely one that is a basis for the R-span of Φ and such that every element of Φ is a linear combination of elements of ∆ with all coefficients weakly of the same sign. It is therefore enough for us to classify all maximal indecomposable cyclotomic matrices. When we consider a cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic cyclotomic matrices. When we consider matrices that have all their eigenvalues in the open interval (−2, 2), we shall see that it is no longer always true that every such matrix is contained in a maximal one: there is an infinite family of indecomposable exceptions. Conjugation by these diagonal matrices corresponds to reversing the signs of all edges incident at a certain vertex v; we call this switching at v. Conjugation by a permutation matrix merely means that we can ignore vertex labels; we therefore do not label the vertices of our graphs. One can mimic a standard proof for graphs (as in [Big, p. 11]; this result first appeared in a Chemistry paper [CoR]), or simply note that if one changes the signs of all edges incident with vertices in one part then χG is unchanged, yet every edge has then changed sign so that χG(x) is changed to (−1)nχG(−x). , e8 and 112 vectors of the form (ei ± ej ± ek ± eℓ), where ijkℓ is one of the vertices of the form (i i, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j,\n",

      ") patterns in their BFs. The least tendency of variability from the trend of strict monotonicity coupled with uniform decrement in mean BF suggests clearly that BF decrement observed in VAL, THR, PHE, SER, PRO across all four major structural classes along the entire span of evolutionary journey has been most decisive. At the most global level, considering all the non-redundant proteins in 75 most populous folds, Table-1 reports that SER BF is 25Å2 as compared to CYS BF, 23Å2.Though small, this difference is significant because in Table-1 the maximum-to-minimum variance of BF is merely ~9Å2 (between GLU and VAL). While the reduction of residue-flexibility during all-α to all-β transition is found to be minimal or non-existent for most of the residues, CYS flexibility for this transition shows a decisively opposite trend whereby a significant increment of CYS BF could be registered during all-alpha to all-beta transition, which was found to be second only to, most interestingly, LYS. To view the general nature of residue B-factors, one may attempt to assign the cause behind observed absence of monotonicity in CYS BF profile and its poor correlation with evolutionary scale to the varied physico-chemical constraints that CYS was subjected to, which is presented in details in (Heitmann 1968; McConnell et al., 1993; Nagano et al., 1999; Rawlings et al., 2004). Effects ofCYS BF could be registered during all-alpha to all-beta transition, which was found to be second only to, most interestingly, LYS. One may attempt to assign the cause behind observed absence of monotonicity in CYS BF profile and its poor correlation with evolutionary scale to the varied physico-chemical constraints that CYS was subjected to, which is presented in details in (Heitmann 1968; McConnell et al., 1993; Nagano et al., 1999; Rawlings et al., 2004). Effects ofCYS's having the lowest BF among all the polar residues on the biophysical properties of CYS can be estimated by the fact that even in the solvent-exposed highly flexible regions the loops are often stabilized by disulfide bonds, a process that demands maintenance of reduction of local mobility. Not surprisingly therefore the mean and standard deviation of BFs of these residues (ILE:22.34(5.70), LEU:22.98(6.26), VAL:22.02(5.73)) contrast starkly with that of the reactive residues (GLU:31.25(7.29), ASP:28.93(6.81), ARG:28.20(7.22), LYS:28.84(8.02)) that commonly reside on the solvent-exposed surface of proteins. For example, though VAL and THR are of roughly the same shape and volume and though it often proves to be difficult to distinguish VAL from THR (even in a high-resolution protein structure), merely because VAL differs from THR by replacement of the hydroxyl group with a methyl substituent, THR acquires slightly polar character; whereby, irrespective of structural classes THR registers higher BF than VAL (THRBF-mean α/β – VALBF-meanα/β = 2.20Å , THRBF-mean α+β – VALBF-meanα/β = 2.20Å , THRBF-mean α+β – VALBF-meanα+β = 2.72Å , THRBF-mean all-α – VALBF-meanall-α = 1.87Å , THRBF-mean all-β – VALBF-meanall-β = 1.59Å ). Such subtle chemical differences account for subtle differences in GLU and ASP's reactivity profile also; whereby we observe that despite being subjected to similar evolutionary pressure (correlation coefficient between BF and evolutionary scale for ASP is -0.31, that for GLU is -0.32, details in TABLE-3) not only the global mean BF of GLU (31.25) is higher than that of ASP (28.93) but also, irrespective of structural classes GLU registered higher BF than ASP (GLUBF-mean α/β – ASPBF-meanα/β = 3.13Å , GLUBF-mean α+β – ASPBF-meanα+β = 2.0Å , GLUBF-mean all-α – ASPBF-mean all-α = 1.55Å , GLUBF-mean all-α – ASPBF-mean all-α = 1.55Å , GLUBF-mean all-α – ASPBF-mean all-α = 1.59Å ).

Then, by Lemma 4.1, there exists a finite quotient, Q, of F in which the image of r is central and has order n. Let F0 be the kernel of the map from F to Q and consider the subgroup Γ0 = F0σ. Hence we can write u as a product of conjugates of r ± as follows, u = Y k i= g − i r ǫi in F/F0, where each ǫi = ±1 and the gi ∈ F. Note that since r is central in F/F0 we have that u = r m in F/F0, where m = Pk i= 1 ǫi . In particular, we do this by analysing the action on the normal subgroup C. In fact, by Theorem 4.3, it is sufficient to consider the case when C is infinite cyclic, so henceforth we shall assume that C ∼= Z.CONJUGACY SEPARABILITY OF SEIFERT MANIFOLDS We let h denote the generator of this Z and note that every conjugate of h is equal to either h or h − . In fact, we do this by analysing the action on the normal subgroup C. In fact, by Theorem 4.3, it is sufficient to consider the case when C is infinite cyclic, so henceforth we shall assume that C ∼= Z.CONJUGACY SEPARABILITY OF SEIFERT MANIFOLDS We let h denote the generator of this Z and note that every conjugate of h is equal to either h or h − . In particular, the subgroup hh k i is a normal subgroup of π1(M) for each integer k. Our strategy will be to show that if two elements in π1(M) are not conjugate, then they will also fail to be conjugate in a quotient of π1(M) by some hh k i.CONJUGACY SEPARABILITY OF SEIFERT MANIFOLDS We let h denote the generator of this Z and note that every conjugate of h is equal to any conjugate of h is equal to either h or h − . In particular, the subgroup hh k i is the subgroup of C of index at most 2 which centralise h. Consider x1, x2 ∈ C + and suppose that x − i gxi = ghni. By Theorem 4.3, it is sufficient to prove the theorem in the case where we have a short exact sequence of groups associated to a Seifert 3-manifold, M, of the form 1 → Z → π1(M) → H → 1, where H is a virtual surface group and Z is generated by an element h. So let us consider two elements g, g1 ∈ π1(M) which are conjugate. Given a group S we call an automorphism, φ, of S virtually inner if φ n is inner for some integer n. Given a virtually inner automorphism, φ, let S∗φ denote the group hS, t : t n = ghnfor some integer n. However, by Lemma 5.1, there exist integers λ, λ so that an element of the form ghm is conjugate to g in π1(M) if and only if m = kλ or m = kλ + λ0 for some integer n. Let C + be the subgroup of π1(M) where n is chosen to be the least integer such that φ n is inner and x is chosen so that gφn = x − gx for all g ∈ S. This group has S as a subgroup of finite index. ✷ The purpose of introducing our seemingly cumbersome terminology (twisted-φ conjugacy) is that it enables us to pass between finite extensions of a group, S, by describing the separability properties of the extension solely in terms of S. Proposition 3.5. We observe the following, {w − gw : w ∈ G} = Sr i=1{x − gix : x ∈ S} = Sr i=1 gi [1]φi, where [1]φiis understood to be a twisted-φi conjugacy class in S. By hypothesis, each [1]φiis closed in S and thence in G. Thus each gi[1]φiis closed in G and thus so is the (finite) union. We note that this is already known, see\n",

      "In the finite measure preserving case, it was proven that the collection of weak mixing transformations generates all rigidity sequences for all ergodic transformations defined on a Lebesgue space. It was established in [36] and [37] that any rigidity sequence of a conservative ergodic infinite measure preserving transformation occurs as a rigidity sequence of a probability preserving weak mixing transformation. A σ-finite measure preserving transformation is rationally weakly mixing, if it is conservative ergodic and there exists a set F of finite positive measure such that for all measurable sets A, B ⊂ F, limn→∞ an(F) Xn− k= |µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(A ∩ T kB) − µ(F)| = 0. Since it was shown in [7] and [21] that any rigid sequence of an ergodic finite measure preserving transformation may be realized by a finite measure preserving transformation, then it is sufficient to assume the starter transformation R is weak mixing, and rigid on ρn.

Since the normalizing term aN in the rationally weakly mixing condition may grow at a rate much slower than N, it is not clear this condition will hold for all measurable subsets A ⊆ F, when it holds for a dense collection of sets contained in F. In this section, we give conditions that allow extension of the rational weak mixing condition from a dense collection of sets in F to all measurable sets contained in F. Let P be a dense collection of sets, each a subset of F. Lemma 4.1.

By Lemma 2.1(c), they are H-invariant which shows the claim.ON THE INDUCTIVE MCKAY–NAVARRO CONDITION FOR B2(2f ) AND G2(3f) For the local characters, we know that all η ∈ Irrℓ ′ (WCG(s)(T0) vF ) for semisimple s ∈ TvF are Hinvariant. If we have d = 1, then we can assume that the groups N and TF are stable under the action of D. Since TF is abelian, the same holds for its Sylow ℓ-subgroup. Thus, we can use GAP [GAP19] to construct the automorphism ϕ of W1 induced by γ f. We can use GAP [GAP19] to construct the automorphism ϕ of W1 induced by γ f. We can use GAP [GAP19] to construct the automorphism ϕ of W1 induced by γ f. We can use GAP [GAP19] to construct the automorphism ϕ of W1 induced by γ f. We can use GAP [GAP19] to construct the automorphism ϕ of W1 induced by γ f explicitly, compute the irreducible characters of W1 ⋊hϕi, and thereby determine extensions of η5 and η6, respectively, see Table 4.1. We work in the twisted setting and consider NvF ∼= N. We know from [MS15, Section 3.A] that we find an automorphism γ2 ∈ Aut(G) stabilizing T0 that acts on G in the same way as γ such that γ 2f 2 = vF. If χ is semisimple or regular, we can use Gelfand–Graev characters and Deligne–Lusztig theory for disconnected reductive groups to construct a (hF3i × H)χinvariant extension of χ to G ⋊ Dχ, see [Joh22a, Proposition 4.13]. Using [GHL+96], we can read off the character values ρ(s) for a regular element s ∈ Aut(G) and write Aut(G)H for the setwise stabilizer of H ≤ G in Aut(G). 12 ON THE INDUCTIVE MCKAY–NAVARRO CONDITION FOR B2(2F ) AND G2(3F ) x ∈ G. If a is an inner automorphism, we also use the group element itself to denote conjugation with g ∈ G. We write Aψ to denote the elements of A ≤ Aut(G) stabilizing the character ψ of G. We consider the following simplified condition. This condition implies the inductive McKay–Navarro condition from [NSV20, Definition 3.5] for groups with cyclic outer automorphism groups since, in this case, we do not have to keep track of the scalars corresponding to the extensions on CG⋊(Aut(G)R)ψ(N), see [Joh22a, Lemma 4.6]. Let G be a connected reductive group defined over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and F a Frobenius endomorphism of G. If L is an F-stable Levi subgroup of G, we denote the relative Weyl group of L in G by WG(L) := NG(L)/L. We write E(GF , TF , s) for the set of irreducible consituents of the Deligne–Lusztig generalized character RG T (s) where T ⊆ G∗ is an F-stable maximal torus containing s. The irreducible characters of GF are parametrized by pairs (s, ν) where s ∈ G∗F ∗ is semisimple and ν is a unipotent character of CG∗F ∗ (s).

All single Abranes with P < −112 in combination with 3B × 2B and no further B-branes are similarly ruled out, so we immediately see that without at least one additional B-brane, none of the B-brane combinations with maximum total tadpole above 120 contributing to Figure 3 can satisfy K-theory. While the emphasis of this paper is on developing general tools which can be useful either for model-building or for understanding the distribution of models in this corner of the landscape, it is useful to make contact with more detailed model-building results by checking that the specific models found in earlier work are contained within the larger classes of configurations constructed here. For example, in [13, 14], Cvetiˇc, Shiu and Uranga identified a model containing SU(3) × SU(2) and – 34 –3 generations of quarks on the orientifold with one tilted torus using the configuration of B-branes (in our notation, with the contribution of ˜m1 to the tadpole) and a few generations of quarks on the orientifold with one tilted torus using the configuration of B-branes (in our notation, with the contribution of ˜m1 to the tadpole) and a few generations of quarks on the orientifold with one tilted torus using the configuration of B-branes (in our notation, with the contribution of ˜m1 to the tadpole) and a few generations of quarks on the orientifold with one tilted torus using the configuration of B-branes (in our notation, with the contribution of ˜m1 to the tadpole) and a few generations of quarks on the orientifold with one tilted torus (in our notation, with the contribution of ˜m1 to the tadpole) and a few generations of quarks on the orientifold with one tilted torus (in our notation, with the contribution of ˜m1 to the tadpole) and a few generations of quarks on the orientifold with one tilted torus (in our notation, with the contribution of ˜m1 to the tadpole), we have bounds on all winding numbers except for n and n . The two Abrane combinations have larger positive total tadpoles than the single brane configurations with similar negative tadpole, so that the single brane gives space for a wider variety of – 19 –# tilted tori\\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 242 24783 27712 10068 1375 477 36 2 136 5897 4868 3127 422 222 9 3 29 471 277 354 38 36 0 Table 3: Number of configurations of n A-branes having all total tadpoles ≤ T = 8 with 1, 2, or 3 tilted tori. We can realize all brane combinations realizing these constraints by simply constructing all brane combinations for the rectangular torus, relating miin the construction to 2 ˜mi and imposing the additional condition that on a tilted torus there must be an even number of any brane with ni 6≡ mi (mod 2), corresponding to half that number of branes with twice the ni and ˜mi equal to that mi. Practically, we can find configurations realizing a desired gauge group on a compact torus by computing the configurations on untilted tori by computing the configurations on untilted tori, and then checking whenever there is a stack of N branes with ni 6≡ mi on k tilted tori that an additional N(2k − 1) branes of this kind can be added without oversaturating the tadpole conditions.\n",

      "1 Introduction This article contains the statement and proof of an algorithm for checking divisibility by all integers which have 1, 3, 7 or 9 in their unit's place. In fact, if there are n + 1 digits in A, ak = 0 for all k > n. We now have to take a0, i.e., the number in the unit's place, multiply by 5, add a1 to it, multiply the sum by 5, add a2 to it, and continue like this until we exhaust all digits of A. The steps in the algorithm can be represented in a tabular form as follows: digit add result of last row mod 7 × 5 mod 1 1 5 4 9 2 10 9 12 5 25 3 7 0 0 (2) The final result is zero, and therefore 7 | 3941, i.e., 3941 is divisible by 7, as can be checked by direct division. As emphasized earlier, this includes all primes except 2 and 5, although the algorithm described holds independently of whether the divisor is a prime. (1), is divisible by d. We have to follow an algorithm like the one discussed by Kordemsky, except that now at each step we need to multiply by q. (4) Obviously, if the number of digits in A is n+1, we will obtain Cˆ k = Cˆ n for all k > n. Thus, this includes all primes except 2 and 5, although the algorithm described holds independently of whether the divisor is a prime. (5), is divisible by d. We have to follow an algorithm like the one discussed by Kordemsky, except that now at each step we need to multiply by q. (4) Obviously, if the number of digits in A is n+1, we will obtain Cˆ k = Cˆ n for all k > n. Thus, Cˆ k will not change if we increase k indefinitely. (6) Like its hatted relative, Ck also has a terminal value, which will be denoted by C, which can be called the d-modded digital sum of A. (1), is written alternatively as A = Xn k= a ′ k × 10k , (7) without any restriction on the a ′ k 's except that all of them need to be integers. Then the ordered set {a ′ k } will be called a \"shuffled representation\" of the number A, and the process from changing from one such representation to another will be called a \"shuffling\". Obviously, shuffled representations of a number include its regular decimal representation, which has the additional restriction 0 ≤ a ′ k ≤ 9 for all k. But a ′ k is not restricted to be a single-digit positive number. It is then enough to show that C (r) = C. Obviously, the shuffling of a number does not disturb the numbers ak for k ≤ r−2, and therefore C (r) k = Ck for k ≤ r − 2. (8), we find that the next step gives C (r) r−1 = Cr−1 + 10mod d , (10) and, in the step after that, we get C (r) r = q(Cr−1 + 10) + ar − mod d = Cˆ r + md mod d , (11) using Eq. (12) For k > r, it does not make any difference whether we are using the ak's or the shuffled set. For q > 1, we will use the result [2] that, for integers a > b > 0, gcd(a, b) = gcd(a − b, b), (13) which forms the basis of the Euclid algorithm for finding greatest common divisors. Repeated application of this rule gives gcd(md, q) = gcd(q − 1, q) = gcd(q, q − 1, gcd(q, q − 1), (14) where in the last step, we find that the procedure of finding C coincides with finding the digital sum of A modulo 9, which is what constitutes the usual divisibility test for 9. 53 Illustrations and variations with prime divisors It is to be noted that the class of divisors defined in Eq. Along with the trivial tests for divisibility, we will use the trivial tests for divisibility by 2 and 5. Along with the trivial tests for divisibility by 2 and 5, we will use the Euclid algorithm for finding greatest common divisors. Repeated application of this rule gives gcd(a, b) = gcd(a − b, b, b), (13) which forms the basis of the Euclid algorithm for finding greatest common divisors. Repeated application of this rule gives gcd(a\n",

([24, Definition 6.1]) A subset A of a T0 space X is called a well-filtered determined set, WD set for short, if for any continuous mapping f : X → Y to a well-filtered space Y , there exists a unique yA ∈ Y such that f(A) = {yA}. (1) X is called a directed closure space, DC space for short, if Irrc(X) = Dc(X), that is, for each A ∈ Irrc(X), there exists a directed subset D of X such that A = D. The category of all DC spaces with continuous mappings is denoted by Topdc. Since the K1-reflection of X agrees with the K2-reflection of X, there exists a unique continuous mapping (ˆηX) k : PH(K1(X)) → PH(K2(X)) such that A = D. The category of all DC spaces with continuous mappings is denoted by Topdc. Since the K1-reflection of X agrees with the K2-reflection of X, there exists a unique continuous mapping (ˆηX) k : PH(K1(X)) → PH(K2(X)) such that (ˆηX) k◦ηX = ˆηX, and also there exists a unique continuous mapping (ηX) k : PH(K2(X)) → PH(K1(X)) such that (ηX) k◦ηX = ˆηX, that is, the following two diagrams commute. For an object a of A, a reflection of a in B, B-reflection of a for short, and C-reflection of a for short, there exists a unique continuous mapping (ηa) k : PH(K1(X)) → PH(K2(X)) such that k◦ηX = ˆηX, that is, the following diagram commutes. In this paper, we will answer the above question in the negative by showing that none of Topdc, Toprd, Topwd, QSob, WSob and Topcut is reflective in Top0. A nonempty subset D of a poset P is called directed if every two elements in D have an upper bound in D. The set of all directed sets of P is denoted by D(P). A subset I ⊆ P is called an ideal of P if I is a directed lower subset of P. A subset I ⊆ P is called an ideal of P if I is a directed lower subset of P. The poset of all ideals (with the order of set inclusion) of P is denoted by Id P. P is called a directed complete poset, or dcpo for short, provided that ∨D exists in P for each D ∈ D(P). Obviously, P is a dcpo iff ∨I exists in P for each I ∈ Id P. The poset P is said to be Noetherian if it satisfies the ascending chain condition (ACC for short): every ascending chain has a greatest member. The set Aδis called the cut closure of A in P. If Aδ = A, we say that A is a cut in P. The complete lattice δ(P) = {Aδ: A ⊆ P} (with the order of set inclusion) is called the Dedekind-Macneille completion of P (cf. If G ⊆ Irr(X), then {3GU : U ∈ O(X)} is a topology on G. The space PH(C(X) \\ {∅}) is called the Hoare power space or lower space of X and is denoted by PH(X) for short (cf. A subset A of a topological space X is called saturated if A equals the intersection of all open sets containing it (equivalently, A is an upper set in the specialization preorder). We shall use K(X) to denote the set of all nonempty compact saturated subsets of X and endow it with the Smyth preorder, that is, for K1, K2 ∈ K(X), K1 v K2 iff K2 ⊆ K1.

The definition of the entropy weak solution with concentration is stated in Section 2 and in short, we can say that such solution is entropy weak to (1.11) in Ω but delta point masses are present along the interfaces in the momentum equation when the solution is tested on the whole half plane. The point masses correspond to the values of pressure evaluated within the nonvacuum region and render the solution conserving mass and momentum in the following sense: From the integral identity of (1.11)1, that is ZZ {ρφt + mφx} dxdt = 0 , ∀ φ ∈ C ∞ (R × (0, ∞)) and the Rankine-Hugoniot condition [m] = ˙x[ρ] that hold along the interfaces a(t) and b(t) thanks to (1.9), we get immediately that conservation of total mass holds true: Z R ρ(x, t) dx = Z I(t) ρ + p(ρ) φx dxdt − K ZZ [M m − M1(t) ρ] φ dxdt − Z ∞ [p(ρ(b(t)−, t))φ(b(t), t) − p(ρ(a(t)+, t))φ(a(t), t)] dt = 0 (2.3) where M and M1(t) are given in (1.12) and (1.13), respectively.

A contact structure on a manifold M of odd dimension 2n + 1 is a completely non-integrable 2n-dimensional tangent plane distribution ξ. A contact structure can be viewed as an equivalence class of contact differential forms, where two forms α and α ′ are equivalent if and only if α ′ are equivalent if and only if α ′ = fα where f is a nowhere zero smooth function on M. A contact manifold is a pair (M2n+1, η) where M is a smooth manifold of dimension 2n + 1 and η is a contact structure on M, [E, MS]. We say that a Lie algebra g of dimension 2n + admits a contact structure if there is an element η of degree 1 in the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (Λg ∗ , d) of g such that η ∧ (dη) n 6= 0. Since every invariant diferential form on a nilmanifold N/Γ is completely determined by its values on the Lie algebra n of N, we conclude that a nilmanifold N/Γ admits an invariant contact structure if and only if n admits a contact structure. Conversely, for any contact form α on N/Γ we can perform the averaging of the lift of α to N rescaled down by a nowhere zero function with the finite integral and get an invariant contact form α. Next, for a given 7-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra having a contact structure, we must check whether the corresponding simply connected Lie group contains a discrete cocompact subgroup. A differential graded algebra (DGA) over a field k of characteristic 0 is a graded vector space A = ⊕ ∞ i=0A i with multiplications Ap⊗Aq → Ap+q which are associative and commutative in graded sense a · b = (−1)|a|·|b|b · a where |a| and |b| denote the degrees of a and b respectively in the underlying graded vector space.

The second one is Hcvx(Vw(X)), where Vw(X) is the space of continuous valuations on X [23, 22] (more details in Section 18), or equivalently the space of linear previsions (defined as sublinear previsions, except that F(h + h ) = F(h) + F(h ) replaces the inequality F(h+h ) ≤ F(h+h ) ≤ F(h)+F(h )), H(Y ) is the space of non-empty closed subsets of Y with the lower bound, and Hcvx(X) is the space of non-empty closed subsets of X [23, 22] (more details in Section 18), or equivalently the space of linear previsions (defined as sublinear previsions, except that F(h + h ) = F(h) + F(h ) replaces the inequality F(h+h ) ≤ F(h)+F(h )), H(Y ) is the space of non-empty closed subsets of Y with the lower bound, and Hcvx(X) is the space of non-empty closed subsets of Y with the lower bound, and Hcvx(X) is the space of non-empty closed subsets of Y. The already cited Theorem 4.11 of [14] states that PAP(X) and Hcvx(Vw(X)) are homeomorphic if LX is locally convex in its Scott topology, meaning that every element of LX has a base of convex open neighborhoods. We note that those properties fail in domain-complete and non-coherent topology. Theorem 4.11 of [14] is also true. Theorem 4.11 of [15] is true. Theorem 4.11 of [15] is true.

Given any binary relation R on L, there is a least congruence preorder R such that u R v for all (u, v) ∈ R. In particular, for every subset A of L, there is a least congruence preorder A such that > A v for every v ∈ A, where > is the largest element of L. Using [31, Section 11.2] for instance, one can check that L/A can be equated with the subframe of L consisting of the A-saturated elements of L, namely those elements u ∈ L such that u = (a ⇒ u) for every a ∈ A, where ⇒ is the largest element of L. The adjunction O a pt restricts to an adjoint equivalence between the full subcategories of LCS-complete spaces (resp., domain-complete spaces) and the opposite of the category of quotient frames L/A, where A is a countable subset of L and L is a continuous distributive (resp., completely distributive) continuous lattice.

For that, let G be a group with a set of generators R := {α1, ..., αn−1}, set α0 := 1 and define αi,j := α − i αj for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n − We will also define G + J := hαi,j |i, j ∈ {0, ..., n − 1} And we will naturally ask that this group follows the intersection condition (IC+) of the C +-groups. When question marks appear in the table, it means we decided to stop the computations after more than 18 days of computing. One of the most spectacular timing differences is for the group P SU(3, 7) which took less than 20A NEW ALGORITHM FOR CHIRAL POLYTOPES. The algorithm is based on the assumption that the group P SU(3, 7) will be a chiral polytopes and the group P SU(3, 7) will be a chiral polytopes and the group P SU(3, 7) which took less than 20A NEW ALGORITHM FOR CHIRAL POLYTOPES is based on the assumption that the group P SU(3, 7) will be a chiral polytopes and the group P SU(3, 7) will be a chiral polytopes and the group P SU(3, 7) will be a chiral polytopes and the group P SU(3, 7) will be a chiral polytopes and the group P SU(3, 7) will be a chiral polytopes and the group P SU(3, 7) will be a chiral polytopes. If Ψ is called an even flag of P (with respect to Φ) if there exists a sequence Φ = Φ0, Φ1, ..., Φ2k−1, Φ2k = Ψ of adjacent flags. Let us define, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n − 1, then the group G+ extended by σ is regular on Γ. We have proved in the previous section that the algorithm that is searching for all generators of a C +-group G with the additional condition on the linearity of the diagram given by (10) is correct in the sense that it will find all existing chiral polytopes having G has an automorphism group. Let R = {α1, ..., αn−1} be a set of elements of G and g be an element of G. Then, R = {α1, ..., αn−1} is in B if and only if R′ = {gα1g − , gα2g − , ..., gαn−1g −1} is in B and the chiral polytopes associated to both sets of generators are isomorphic. This lemma shows that we can restrict our choice of α1 to one element of each conjugacy classes of elements of order greater than or equal to 3, since every chiral polytope obtained by taking a second element ˜α1 that lies in the same conjugacy class as α1 is isomorphic to a chiral polytope already listed thanks to α1. function ChiralPolytopes(G) c:= ConjugacyClasses(G); K:=[[c[i][3]] : i in [1..#c] | c[i][1] gt 2 and c[i][3] in G]; I := []; i := 2;10 F.

Hence the vertices at distance one from C6 are partioned into three sets: W3 = {w : w has exactly three successive neighbors in C6}; W4 = {w : w has exactly four successive neighbors in C6}; W2 = {w : w has exactly four successive neighbors in C6}; W2 = {w : w has two pairs of two successive neighbors in C6}. let v1, v2, w1, w2 be the neighbors of w. Suppose that it exists w 0 ∈ W2 with the same neighbors as w. Since G is a Twin Clique Partition ww must be a non-edge. Let v1, v2, w1, w2 be the neighbors of w. We are interested in characterizing the vertices v ∈ core(G), the vertices v ∈ corona(G), the vertices v ∈ corona(G), the vertices v ∈ anticore(G). The following characterizations are given in [9] page 137: Theorem 1.1 A vertex v ∈ V + iff 1. v is not an isolate vertex and v ∈ core(G), and 2. no subset S ⊆ V − N[v] with cardinality γ(G) dominates G − v. Theorem 1.2 A vertex v ∈ V + iff 1. v is not an isolate vertex and v ∈ core(G), and 2. no subset S ⊆ V − N[v] with cardinality γ(G) dominates G − v. Theorem 1.2 A vertex v ∈ V − iff pn[v, S] = {v} for some γ-set containing v. Remark 1.1 From Theorem 1.2 no vertex v ∈ anticore(G) implies that v ∈ V +. 4 Particular partitions of the vertex-set Relatively to the potential partitions of V into core(G), corona(G)−core(G), anticore(G) and V , V +, we give connected graphs (without isolated vertices) whose vertex-set correspond to a specific partition. Remark 2.1 One can note that any mds of Gv+u contains either u or v. Moreover if there exists a mds of Gv+u that contains u then there is another one that contains v (note that the converse is not necessarily true). From Remark 2.1 any mds S of Gv + u contains either u or v. It follows that S has one vertex more than any mds of G. Now let v 6∈ anticore(G). Given a graph G = (V, E) ∈ C and v ∈ V the problem of deciding if either v ∈ core(G) or v ∈ anticore(G) or v ∈ corona(G) − core(G) is in P. Proof: Let G ∈ C. To compute k the minimum size of a dominating set can be done in polynomial time. So deciding if either v ∈ core(G) or v ∈ anticore(G) or v ∈ corona(G) − core(G) is in P. 3 Presence of vertices in core(G) ∩ V for some classes of graphs As stated by Theorem 2.3 there are exactly three types of vertices in core(G). Moreover we show that determining the status of a vertex can be done in linear time for trees and interval graphs, two subclasses of chordal graphs. In the case where H ∈ {bull, P6}, or H is a subgraph of the bull or P6, we show that v ∈ core(G) = ∅, the complete bipartite graph K3,3 is one of them. Also we give some graphs for which the partition of the vertex set omits some particular type of vertices, relatively to our characterization. These studies include the following question: For theses specific classes of graphs the status of a given vertex can be decided in polynomial time?\n",

      "Introduction For integer polynomials f(x) it is a very difficult problem to say something useful about the size and the number of prime divisors of values f(n), n ∈ Z. It is conjectured that irreducible integer polynomials f(x) without any fixed prime divisor take prime values for infinitely many n, and it is even believed that there are infinitely many prime numbers p for which f(p) is prime. In [HB00] Heath-Brown proved that for an explicitly given positive δ the largest prime divisor of n 3 + 2 is larger than X1+δ for a positive proportion of integers n in the interval [X, 2X]. On the other hand, in [B20] it was shown by Bober, Fretwell, Martin and Wooley that for a fixed quadratic integer polynomial f(x) and a positive ǫ there are infinitely many integers n such that all prime divisors of f(n) are less than n ǫ . Thus, it is typically a very difficult problem obtaining information about the prime divisors of polynomials f(x) and f(p) and f(p) and f(p) and f(p p) and f(p p) and f(p p) and f(p p ) for all p ≥ max{N, |a0|}. There is a constant C := C(g(x)) only dependent on g(x) such that there are infinitely many primes q for which g(x) mod q splits completely and such that any root of g(x) mod q splits completely and such that any root of g(x) mod q has order at most C modulo q.6 B. KLAHN Proof. Note that as a0 6= 0 we must have (r, q) = 1, and thus by Dirichlet's Theorem for Primes in Arithmetic Progressions there are infinitely many primes p > r such that p ≡ r (mod q). By the Prime Number Theorem for Primes in Arithmetic Progressions there are infinitely many primes q for which g(x) mod q splits completely and such that any root of g(x) mod q splits completely modulo q and such that q 6≡ 1 (mod p1p2 · · · pT ). In fact, Chebotarëv's density theorem is one of the key tools in our study of which monic integer polynomials, f(x), satisfy the condition (1.1) f(p) | f(p p ) for all sufficiently large primes p ≥ N(f). For a nonnegative integer n define rad(n) = 1 if n = 0 or n = 1, and otherwise rad(n) = p1p2 · · · pk where p1 < p2 < · · pk are all the distinct prime factors of n. The problem above was submitted for the International Mathematical Olympiad in 20121, see [IMO12]. Altering the formulation of the olympiad problem to only having information at primes makes the problem harder, and the answer to the problem of which monic integer polynomials satisfy (1.1) is richer in the sense that there are more types of polynomials satisfying this condition than the condition of the olympiad problem. There is a positive integer N := N(f) such that (2.1) f(p) | f(p p ), for all primes p ≥ N, if and only if there are positive integers d1, ..., dm and nonnegative integers e0, e1, ..., em such that (2.2) f(x) = x e0Φd (x) e1Φd (x) e · · · Φdm(x) em, 1A polynomial, f(x), satisfies this condition if and only if f(x) = axm for some nonnegative integers a and mA DIVISOR PROBLEM FOR POLYNOMIALS where Φd(x) is the product of certain cyclotomic polynomials. Theorem 3.1 will be crucial because it will allow us to apply the following trick that later will show that any solution f(x) must, essentially, be a product of cyclotomic polynomials. As such, Lemma 3.2 can be generalized since the existence of infinitely many primes p such that (h(x) mod p) | f(p p ), for all primes p ≥ N, if and only if f(x) = axm for some nonnegative integers e0Φd (x) e1Φd (x) em, 1A polynom\n",

Our approach of computing intersection of sets is based on Groebner basis based elimination algorithm which gives us quadratic or linear expressions for the minimum time to consensus and the corresponding states in terms of initial conditions. The key ideas used in the paper are applicable to a variety of systems where attainable sets are convex and their boundaries can be tractably characterized.

Heindorf in the article [Hei02] using the following concept: Let ρ ⊆ XJ be a relation on X indexed by J and let f ∈ O(n). Gn = {f ∈ O(1) : if A ⊆ X has cardinality n then |X \\ f[X \\ A]| ≥ n} Consequently the number of such clones is countably infinite.MAXIMAL CLONES ABOVE THE PERMUTATIONS In the theorem, \"almost all\" means \"all but finitely many\", \"almost injective\" means that there exists a finite subset A of X such that the restriction of f to X\\A is injective, and \"almost surjective\" means that the range of f is co-finite. 2.1.2 Maximal clones above O(1) Although on an infinite set X not every clone must be contained in a maximal one [GS04], the sublattice of Cl(X) of functions containing O(1) is dually atomic by Zorn's lemma, since O is finitely generated over O(1). M. Goldstern and S. Shelah extended this result to clones on weakly compact cardinals in the article [GS02], where an uncountable cardinal X is called weakly compact iff whenever we colour the edges of a complete graph G of size X with two colours, then there exists a complete subgraph of G of size X on which the colouring is constant. Secondly, on countable X, if we equip O with the natural topology which we shall specify later, then T2 is a non-analytic set in that space and so is Pol(T2); in particular, neither hT2i nor Pol(T2) are countably generated over O(1) (see [Gol0x]), where for a set of functions F we denote by hT2i and F we denote by hT2i and hT2i and hT2i and hT2i are countably generated over O(1) (see [Gol0x]), where for a set of functions F we denote by hT2i and F we denote by hT2i and hT2i and hT2i and hT2i are countably generated over O(1) (see [Gol0x]). The clones hT1i and Pol(T1) on the other hand turn out to be rather simple with respect to this topology, and both clones are finitely generated O(1). But mind we are not talking about how rapidly functions are growing in the sense of polynomial growth, exponential growth and so forth since we are considering clones modulo O(1) (and so we can make functions as steep as we like); the growth of a function will be determined by which of its variables are responsible for the function to obtain many values. Select further a large C ⊆ B such that each component in the sequence of tuples (x : x ∈ C) is either constant or injective and such that 0 does not occur in any of the injective components (it is a simple combinatorial fact that this is possible). , jk−1} the holding set of x with respect to g.

      "All these L-eigenvalues together with their multiplicities are called the normalized Laplacian spectrum (L-spectrum for short) of G denoted by ∗This work is supported by NSFC (Nos. Throughout this paper, we denote the neighborhood of a vertex v ∈ V(G) by NG(v), the disjoint union of graphs G and H by G ∪ H, the complete graph on n vertices by G ∪ H, and the complete multipartite graph with s parts of sizes n1, . Connected graphs with few distinct eigenvalues have been investigated frequently for several graph matrices over the past two decades, such as the adjacency matrix [3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16–19, 21, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32], the Laplacian matrix [15, 26, 35], the signless Lapalcian matrix [1], the Laplacian matrix [2], the Laplacian matrix [3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16–19, 21, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32], the Laplacian matrix [15, 26, 35], the signless Lapalcian matrix [1], the Seidel matrix [31], and the universal adjacency matrix [22]. With regard to normalized Laplacian matrix, Cavers [6] characterized all connected graphs with at least one vertex of degree 1 having three distinct L-eigenvalues, Van Dam et al. In this paper, we characterize all connected graphs with exactly three distinct Leigenvalues of which one L-eigenvalue is 1, determine all connected bipartite graphs with at least one vertex of degree 1 that have exactly four distinct L-eigenvalues, and find all unicyclic graphs with three or four distinct L-eigenvalues. If λn−i+1 = 0 and λn−i , 0, then G has exactly i connected components, (vii) The L-spectrum of G is the union of the L-spectra of its connected components, (viii) λi ≤ 2 for all i, with λ1 = 2 if and only if some connected component of G is a non-trivial bipartite graph, (ix) G is bipartite if and only if 2 − λiis an L-eigenvalue of G for each i. The well-known Sylvester's law of inertia states that two congruent real symmetric matrices have the same numbers of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues. Therefore, λn−1 = 1 if and only if the second largest eigenvalue of A ∗ is equal to 0, which is the case if and only if the second largest eigenvalue of A ∗ is equal to 0, which is the case if and only if the second largest eigenvalue of A ∗ is equal to 0, which is the case if and only if the second largest eigenvalue of A ∗ is equal to 0, which is the case if and only if the second largest eigenvalue of A ∗ is equal to 0, which is the case if and only if the second largest eigenvalue of A ∗ is equal to 0, which is the case if and only if the second largest eigenvalue of A ∗ is equal to 0, which is the case if and only if the second largest eigenvalue of A have the same number of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues due to A ∗ and A are congruent. Under the assumption of (ii), one can similarly verify that the same xi ∈ R n defined above is also an eigenvector of G with respect to the L-eigenvalue p+q p+q− for i = 1, 2, . Note that for any graph G, we have L · D 2 j = 0 · D 2 j, and so D 2 j is an eigenvector with respect to the L-eigenvalue 0 of G. Moreover, if G is connected, from Lemma 2. (vi) we know that 0 is a simple L-eigenvalue of G. Keeping these facts in mind, one can easily deduce the following lemma by using the method of spectral decomposition. Then β ≤ 1, and one of the following holds: (i) β = 1, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices in G have the same neighbors; (ii) β < 1, and − 2m(α−1)(β−1) αβ ≥ du − dv ≥ 2m(α−1)(β−1) αβ ≥ du − dv ≥ 2m(α−1)(β−1) du for any\n",

Early perturbations in the solar system may than have originated from this nearby star, which in the last 4.6 Gyr has moved away to be at the other side of the Milky Way today. On the same account, a star that is in the neighborhood today may have been born in an entirely different galaxy, which merged several Gyr ago with the Milky Way Galaxy. In this way long ago, and far away events may have a direct imprint on the evolution of the solar system here and now, and with that on the evolution of the planet Earth.

In order to appreciate the complexity of the dynamical evolution of the Galaxy scales ranging in size from one to 1018 km (105 parsec), and from a single second to over 1017 seconds (4.6 Gyr) should be appreciated. Incorporating such a wide range in scales in numerical simulations is extremely challenging, and luckily for many modern studies most scales can be omitted with the argument that the relative importance of mutual interactions between the smallest and the largest scales is small. From very specialized models that can predict the evolution of a small set of bodies (N < 102) [4] [15], and models that can accurately predict the dynamics of a modest number of bodies (102 < N < 104) [8] [1] to models that are less accurate but able to predict the overall evolution of many bodies (106 < N < 109) [23] [3]. Like gravitational models, many hydrodynamical models for predicting the evolution of these gas clouds have been developed [24] [11] [14], each having unique properties that we would like to utilize. From plasma magneto-hydrodynamical models for very short time and distance scales [13], and 1d spherical symmetrical models of a star for an accurate description of the processes inside a star over long time-scale [5] [7] [17], to analytically models that describe a few important variable of a star over very long time scales [12] [22]. Finally, a large part of our predictive research is figuring out which physical processes play an important role in the system we are interested in and we do not want to be pinned to any specific model or algorithm. A user does not have to familiarize herself with the specific units or scaled units used in each physics domain, removing a real barrier in learning to use a code. When a user assigns a mass to a radius, an error is raised exactly specifying the problem, which would be much harder to detect if propagated through the simulation. Grids provide multi-dimensional indexed access to the code data, a grid index space is fixed after creation, attribute values can be requested and updated on the grid points. For the timestepping of the code interactions a constant global timestep can be used (this is the simplest case), but more complicated schemes are possible (although progressively more difficult to implement). In a stellar collision problem, a gravitational code can integrate the orbits of two stars as point masses until the stars are close to approach each other to some prespecified distance upon which an exception is raised. With this strict separation one can define the strict separation one can define the Hamiltonian of both systems and two partial Hamiltonians that describe the influence of one system on the other and vise verse. The exact restrictions and the requirements in terms of the astrophysical applications of the different coupling schemes for multi-domain and multi-domain and multi-scale simulations are difficult to generalize, and remain the responsibility of the researcher to generalize, and remain the responsibility of the researcher to check.

      "The extensiveness of Orlicz spaces gives rise to their several significant properties yielding fundamental applications in Fourier analysis, Stochastic analysis, Sobolev space embeddings, nonlinear PDE and more [11]. However, characterization of such functions in terms of the zero set of their Fourier transform is not always possible, as shown by Lev and Olevskii [7] for the spaces L p (R) when 1 < p < 2. Since the Orlicz spaces offer a bigger class of function spaces than the Lebesgue spaces, one can ask whether there are Orlicz spaces other than L (R) and L (R) for which we can characterize the functions whose all translates are complete in terms of the zero set of the Fourier transform. As a result, we are able to characterize those discrete sets Λ ⊂ R such that the system of Λ-translates of some function is complete in these Orlicz spaces. Moreover, rather than looking for characterizing of these functions, one can ask whether there are Orlicz spaces other than L (R) and L (R) for which we can characterize the functions whose all translates are complete in terms of the zero set of the Fourier transform. As a result, we are able to characterize those discrete sets Λ ⊂ R such that the system of Λ-translates of some function is complete in these Orlicz spaces. Moreover, rather than looking for characterizing of these functions, one can also ask whether all translates of a particular function are able to span a dense set for the whole space or not. Agnew [1] proved that whenever you take any simple step function of the form χ[0,h]for some h > 0, then definitely its all translates are complete in L p (R) for every p > 1. Inspired by the variation in the above result in the cases when p = 1 and p > 1, we look for conditions on the Orlicz function Φ so that all translates of any simple step function are complete in L Φ(R) or not. For a given Orlicz function Φ and a measurable set Ω ⊆ R, the Orlicz function Φ and a measurable set Ω ⊆ R, the Orlicz space L Φ(Ω) is a Banach space defined as L Φ(Ω) :=    f : f is measurable on Ω, Z Ω Φ |f(x)| a dx < ∞ for some a >    , equipped with the Luxemburg norm kfkLΦ(Ω) = inf    a > 0 : Z Ω Φ |f(x)| a dx ≤    , where we identify functions which are equal a.e. We will need the following inclusion result proved in [6], according to which the existence of a function whose Λ-translates are complete will ensure the same in another Orlicz space based on a comparison around 0. Main Results First, we characterize those functions in Orlicz spaces, which are continuously embedded in L (R), whose all translates are complete in terms of the zero set of their Fourier transform. [8, p. 85] Let B be a regular semi-simple Banach algebra with the property that the set of elements f such that its Gelfand transform ˆf has compact support is dense in B. Using Lemma 3.2, it is enough to show that L Φ(R) is a regular semi-simple Banach algebra such that the set of those functions whose Gelfand transform has compact support is dense in L Φ(R). Also LΦ(R) is regular, since the topology on Rb given by the Euclidean distance d(ζ, η) = |ζ − η| is equivalent to the topology on Rb generated by functions in the Gelfand representation of L Φ(R), which follows simply from the fact ˆf is a bounded and continuous function for every f ∈ L Φ(R) such that ˆf(ζ) = 0 which is a contradiction to the choice of f.

      "Table 1: Observed solar electron-type neutrino flux, compared to the Standard Solar Model (SSM) predictions as shown in Figure 1. The observed neutrino flux is a function of the observed solar electron-type neutrino flux[6], the observed solar electron-type neutrino flux[7], and their ratio. This χ 2 has 14 terms obtained from the solar neutrino data summarized in Table 1, the atmospheric neutrino data shown in Table 2, and the LSND data[9]: P(¯νµ → ν¯e) = sin2(2θ) = sin2(2θ) = 0.0031 ± 0.0013 for L[km]/E[GeV]= [P(¯νµ → ν¯e)]1/2/1.27 · ∆M2[eV2]≈ 0.73 (here sin2(2θ) corresponds to \"large\" ∆M , and ∆M2corresponds to sin2(2θ) = 1, see discussion in [1]). Because one author[10] of the LSND Collaboration is in disagreement with the conclusion, and because the result has not been confirmed by an independent experiment, we multiply the error by 1.5 and take P(¯νµ → ν¯e) = 0.0031 ± 0.0020.

Note in Table 1 that the ratio of the observed-to-predicted solar neutrino flux is significantly lower for the Homestake experiment than for Sage, Gallex, Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande which are all compatible with 0.5. These latter experiments observe neutrinos within wide energy bands, while the chlorine detector in the Homestake mine observes monochromatic electron-type neutrinos from a 7Be line. Therefore the interference is coherent for up to L∆M2/(2E ·2π) ≈ 30 oscillations from the Sun to the Earth (here ∆M2is either ∆M 21 or ∆M232). Due to this coherence at \"small\" ∆M it is possible to find acceptable solutions with χ 2 < 13.4 as shown in Figure 1. For larger values of ∆M2coherence is lost and we find solutions with χ 2 > 18 which are unacceptable if the Homestake experimental and theoretical errors are correct. If the lower ratio measured by the Homestake experiment is real, we expect that the electron-type neutrino flux of the 7Be line is near a minimum of the oscillation at the average Sun-Earth distance. Then we expect a modulation of the 7Be neutrino flux with a period of half a year, with maximums occurring at the perihelion and aphelion of the Earth orbit.

But H(∂∆n,h) will consist of 4n+2h−2 disjoint closed intervals of R, along with curves H(Li) and H(L ′ i ) lying entirely in U apart from their endpoints which are also endpoints of these intervals of R. We find that the order in which the images under H(Li) and H(L ′ i) appear in U is the same as the order in which the images under H(Li) and H(L ′ i) appear in U. We find that the order in which the images under H of the Li, L ′ i and the intervals appear around ∂H(∂∆n,h) is the same as the order in which the images under H(L ′ i and the intervals appear in U. We find that the order in which the images under H of the Li, L ′ i and the intervals appear around ∂H(∆n,h) = H(∂∆n,h) ⊆ U ∪ (ΩG ∩ R) is the same as the original order around ∂∆n,h (or the opposite order if H is orientation reversing). Just as in [1], this gives us 2n+h−1 pairs of geodesics freely homotopic to the curves they replaced, and paired by a generating set Bi with another fundamental domain Difor each group hBii that lies between these two geodesics. Therefore, by reflecting this picture in the real axis, the group G is generated by elements Bi, each of which possesses a pair of mutually disjoint geometric circles Ci and C ′ i. The process of doubling S along its boundary corresponds to considering the quotient of the whole ordinary set ΩG by G. As G is a Schottky group, ΩG/G is topologically a closed surface of genus r. Therefore we conclude that r = 2n + h − 1 (with n ≥ 0, h ≥ 1 and r ≥ 1). The idea of the proof of theorem 1 is that given any such surface S = U/G, we find a particular reference surface, homeomorphic to S, which has a system of Geometry & Topology Monographs, Volume 1 (1998)Fuchsian Schottky groups simple closed geodesics γ1, . , lr on this reference surface which are properly embedded (they can be thought of as having their endpoints up the \"spouts\"), where liintersects γi once and is disjoint from γj (j 6= i).

A finite directed graph E is called a sandpile graph if E has a unique sink (denote it by s), and for every v ∈ E there is a path p in E such that s(p) = v and r(p) = v.

Birkhoff in [1] shows that the set of all n × n doubly stochastic matrices is the convex hull of all n×n permutation matrices. An m×n matrix E = (ei,j ) is doubly substochastic if it satisfies the following ∗Corresponding author Email addresses: denglei@dgut.edu.cn (Lei Deng), lq016@ie.cuhk.edu.hk (Qiulin Lin) Preprint submitted to Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A October 21, 2018conditions:   ei,j ≥ 0, ∀i = 1, 2, · · · , n; Pn i=1 ei,j = 1, ∀j = 1, 2, · · · , n; Pn i=1 ei,j = 1, ∀j = 1, 2, · · · , n; Pn i=1 ei,j = 1, ∀j = 1, 2, · · · , n; Pn i=1 ei,j = 1, ∀j = 1, 2, · · · , n; Pn i=1 ei,j ≤ 1, ∀j = 1, 2, · · · , m. Mirsky in [2] shows that the set of all n × n doubly substochastic matrices is the convex hull of all n×n subpermutation matrices. It is straightforward to extend Mirsky's result to general m × n matrices because we can always augment a rectangular doubly substochastic matrix to a square doubly substochastic matrix by adding some zero lines. However, if we impose an upper bound 1/k where k is a positive integer k for all entries of doubly stochastic/substochastic matrices, the convex-hull characterization becomes different. Watkins and Merris in [3] prove that the set of all 1/k-bounded doubly stochastic matrices is the convex hull of all doubly stochastic matrices whose entries are either 0 or 1/k. Specifically, we prove that the set of all 1/k-bounded doubly substochastic matrices is the convex hull of all doubly substochastic matrices whose entries are either 0 or 1/k. We also prove that the set of all 1/k-bounded doubly substochastic matrices is the convex hull of all doubly substochastic matrices whose entries are either 0 or 1/k. Our Result Denote A as the set of all doubly substochastic m × n matrices and let k be a positive integer. It is straightforward to show that Ak is a non-empty compact convex set in R m×n and any matrix in Bk is an extreme point of set Ak. Since any non-empty compact convex set in R n is the convex hull of its extreme points [4, Theorem 2.23], to finish the proof, we thus only need to show that any matrix E ∈ Ak \\ Bk is not an extreme point of set Ak. We aim at finding a chain of middle entries of matrix E. We begin with any middle entry, denoted as (r1, c1). In each new middle line, if there are old middle entries, we find the latest-visited old middle entry and terminate; otherwise, we find a new middle entry and continue. Since E only has a finite number of middle entries, the process must terminate by finding an old middle entry, terminating either (i) at a middle entry (rt ′ , ct′ ) which coincides with an old middle entry (rt, ct′ ) which coincides with an old middle entry (rt, ct) or (ii) which coincides with an old middle entry (rt, ct′ ) which coincides with an old middle entry (\n",

We implement algorithm 1 by storing each sol as an array which size equals to its support, recording non-zero positions and corresponding values in lexical order. Intuitively, we could set up an array of values for each weight and convolve it with itself O(log u) times, but while we can get an optimal-valued solution in this way, it's not necessarily of minimal lexical order. 7Algorithm 2 Kernel Computation with Minimum Witness 1: procedure Kernel Computation(σ) 2: k ← ⌊2 log2(u) + 1⌋ 3: Initialize v[0, · · · , ku] and f[0, · · , ku] and f[0, · · , u] to be −∞, sol[0, · · , ku] to be −∞, sol[0, · · , u] to be −∞, sol[0, · · , ku] to be −∞, v[0] ← w1, since we can always add more w1's to a feasible sum to get another feasible sum. With this approach, we arrive at new results for the three problems: All-Target Unbounded Knapsack (Theorem 5.2) Let T(n) be the time required for n-length (min, +) convolution, All-Target Unbounded Knapsack can be solved in Oe(T(u) + t) time.

Specifically, if we fix an arbitrarily chosen lexical order, then the lexicographically smallest optimal solution sol(j) for each feasible target sum j ∈ [1, t] has a support of logarithmic size (i.e. It exploits the following optimal substructure property for lexicographically smallest optimal solutions: for any target j, and for any \"witness\" x ∈ supp(sol(τ )), sol(j−wx) is equal to sol(j) with the multiplicity of x decreased by 1. |sol(j)| = O(log u)), defined as a \"kernel,\" then since the total number of \"witnesses\" is logarithmic, so each 10 log(n + m) is logarithmic, we can use the same as\n",

      "In [17], the biderivations of Lie algebras was introduced and the authors proved that all skew-symmetric biderivations of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are inner. In recent years, many scholars gave their attentions to the study of biderivations of many Lie algebras using case by case discussions, see [3, 4, 14, 13, 8, 15]. It is well known that any biderivation can be decomposed into a sum of a skew-symmetric biderivation and a symmetric biderivation, and all the symmetric biderivations from g to V are trival. In this paper, we study the symmetric biderivations of Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are trival. In this paper, we study the symmetric biderivations from a complex semisimple Lie algebra to its finite-dimensional module. In this paper, we study the symmetric biderivations from a complex semisimple Lie algebra to its finite-dimensional module. In this paper, we study the symmetric biderivations from a complex semisimple Lie algebra to its finite-dimensional module. In this paper, we study the symmetric biderivations from a complex semisimple Lie algebra to its finite-dimensional module. To summarize, we obtain Theorem 4.6. Then each symmetric biderivation δ of g is of the form δ(x + µ1c, y + µ1c) = λµ1µ2c, ∀x, y ∈ g0, µ1, µ2 ∈ C, for a complex number λ.8 SHIYUAN LIU, DONG LIU, AND YUEQIANG ZHAO 4.3. Recall that the symmetric biderivation δ of g is of the form δ(x + µ1c, y + µ1c, ∀x, y + µ2c, ∀x, y ∈ C, for a complex number λ.8 SHIYUAN LIU, DONG LIU, AND YUEQIANG ZHAO 4.3. Recall that the symmetric biderivation δ of g is of the form δ(x + µ1c, y + µ1c) and the super-symmetric biderivations of certain Lie superalgebras. A linear map D : g −→ V is called a derivation from g to V if D([x, y]) = xD(y) − yD(x), ∀x, y ∈ g. Note that a derivation from g to its adjoint representation is just an usual derivation of g. For any v ∈ V, the linear map Dv: g −→ V, x 7−→ xv is a derivation from g to V, which is called inner. A bilinear map δ : g × g −→ V is called a biderivation from g to V if δ([x, y],z) = xδ(y,z) − yδ(x,z), (2.1) δ(x, [y,z]) = yδ(x,z) − zδ(x,z) (2.2) hold for all x, y,z ∈ g. Note that a biderivation from g to its adjoint representation is just a usual biderivation of L. It is elementary to check that a bilinear map δ : g×g −→ V is a biderivation if and only if the linear maps δ(·, x) : g −→ V, y 7−→ δ(y, x), δ(x, ·) : g −→ V, y 7−→ δ(x, y) are both derivations from g to V for any x ∈ g. In this paper, we mainly study the symmetric biderivations from a complex semisimple Lie algebra to its finite-dimensional module. By Weyl's theorem, V is completely irruducible, i.e., V can be written as a direct sum of its irreducible submodules, say V = V1 ⊕ V2 ⊕ · · ⊕ Vm. Hence, V = V2 ⊕ Vm. Hence, V = V2 ⊕ Vm. Hence, V = V2 ⊕ Vm. Hence, V = V2 ⊕ Vm. Hence, V = V2 ⊕ Vm. Hence, V = V2 ⊕ Vm.\n",

      "However, since traditional narrow-angle telescopes cover only a very small portion of the sky at a given time, one can reasonably assume that some bright short-timescale transients may not be recorded by the available narrow-angle sky surveys (Nemiroff 2003). This policy guarantees that optical transients appearing on clear nights are recorded, given that they are brighter than the limiting magnitude of the all-sky camera.– 2 – The ability of all-sky optics to observe faint sources is not comparable to even simple narrow-angle telescopes. However, since the optical transients can be detected by optical transients, it is possible that the optical transients can be detected by optical transients, and that optical transients can be detected by optical transients. This is a concern when using all-sky cameras for the purpose of bright optical transient detection, and for the evaluation of the scientific nature of future transient events recorded by such instruments.

J., 2005, AAS Meeting 205, 48.13– 10 – If a flash appears to be rotating with the sky for several consecutive images, and/or recorded simultaneously by two distant cameras, the flash is alerted as an optical transient candidate. Optical Transient On the night of 4/20/2006, a flash was recorded by two CONCAM all-sky cameras located in Cerro Pachon, Chile and La Palma, Spain. However, since the pixel size of a Night Sky Live image is 10′(Shamir 2005a), and the distance between La Palma and Cerro Pachon is ∼10000 kilometers, sub-pixel positioning cannot lead to distance of less than 3.4 · 106 km.– 5 – Another all-sky MASCOT (Mascot 2006) camera located in Paranal Observatory was also operating at the same time, but did not record the flash (Smette 2006). Coincidental cosmic-ray hits have been previously reported as a potential cause of false positives in cases where a large number of astronomical images are processed, so that seemingly astonishing discoveries (Nemiroff, R. J., Palma and La Palma and La Palma, respectively). The probability of false positives due to cosmic ray hits will be recorded as an optical transient candidate. The probability that such a flash will be recorded in three years by any of the stations is ∼ 4.6 · 10−5, which is approximately 3.9σ. Assuming inaccuracy of one pixel (meaning that the cosmic ray hit can lay anywhere in the 9×9 grid around the exact position), the probability that two cosmic-ray hits will appear at the same location in two consecutive images is 600000 ·6 ≃ 10− . By including also the 2 marginal-quality images taken in La Palma, the probability that cosmic-ray hits have been previously reported as a potential cause of false positives in cases where a large number of astronomical images are processed, so that seemingly astonishing discoveries (Sahu et al. Due to the possibility of false positives due to cosmic ray hits, sky surveys searching for supernovae usually record several exposures of the same field before triggering an alert of a potential discovery (Balland et al. Since the software is running in two CONCAM stations (Cerro Pachon and La Palma), the probability that such a flash will be recorded in three years by any of the stations is ∼ 4.6 · 10−5, which is approximately 3.9σ. Assuming inaccuracy of one pixel (meaning that the cosmic ray hit can lay anywhere in the 9×9 grid around the exact position), the probability that two cosmic-ray hits will appear at the same location in two consecutive images is 600000 ·6 ≃ 10− .
