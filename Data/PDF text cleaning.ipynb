      "1 Introduction The union of a set of n balls in R 3 has quadratic complexity Θ(n ), even if they all have the same radius. All the already known constructions have balls scattered around, however, and Sharir posed the problem whether a quadratic complexity could be achieved if all the balls (of same radius) contained the origin. In this note, we show a construction of n unit balls, all containing the origin, whose union has complexity Θ(n ). As a trivial observation, we observe that the centers are arbitrarily close to the origin in our construction. In fact, if the centers are forced to be at least pairwise ε apart, for some constant ε > 0, then no more than O( ε 3 ) can meet in a single point, and hence the union has complexity at most O( ε 3 n) = Oε(n). It is an interesting open question what a condition should be so that the union have subquadratic complexity and yet the balls have arbitrarily close centers. By contrast, the intersection of n balls can have quadratic complexity if their radii are not constrained, but the complexity is linear if all the radii are the same [2]. Similarly, the convex hull of n balls can have also quadratic complexity [1], but that complexity is linear if they all have the same radius. 2 Construction Let m and k be any integers. We define two families of unit balls: the first consists of k unit balls whose centers lie on a small vertical segment; the second consists of m unit balls whose centers lie on a small circle under the segment. (See Figure 3.) We show below that their union has quadratic O(km) complexity. The balls B1 . . . Bk. We denote by B(p, r) the ball centered at p and of radius r. Let n = k + m and Pi denote the point of coordinates (0, 0,(i − 1)/n4), and Bi = B(Pi, 1), for i = 1, . . . , k. It is clear that the boundary of ∪1≤i≤kBi consists of two hemispheres belonging to B1 and Bk linked by a narrow cylinder of height less than k/n4 ≤ 1/n3. This cylinder contains all the circles ∂Bi∩∂Bi+ for i = 1, . . . , k − 1. (See Figure 1.) ∗ INRIA, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis, France. {Herve.Bronnimann|Olivier.Devillers}@sophia.inria.fr 1Bk B ≤ n Figure 1: The union ∪1≤i≤kBi. The balls Bk+1 . . . Bk+m. Let R be the point of coordinates (x, 0, z) with x = 2n 2 − n , z = − 2n 2 − n . (Any values satisfying the constraints PkH < 1 in (1) and ℓ < n in (2) below would do.) We define θ as the rotation around the z-axis of angle 2π/m, and for each j = 1, . . . , m, Rk+j = θ j− (R) and Bk+j = B(Rk+j, 1). 3 Analysis By our choice of x and z, we prove below that the boundaries of Bk+1 and of the union ∪ k i=1Bi depicted in Figure 1 meet along a curve γ which satisfies the two claims below. The situation is depicted on Figure 2. Claim 1 The curve γ intersects all the balls Bifor i = 0, . . . , k, . Claim 2 The portion of γ which does not belong to B1 (equivalently, which belongs to the union ∪ k i=2Bi) is contained in an angular sector of angle at most 2π/m. From claim 2, we conclude that the portion of γ which does not belong to B1 is contained in the boundary of the union of the n = k + m balls, From claim 1, we conclude that the portion of γ which does not belong to B1 has complexity Ω(k). From claim 2, that it is contained in a small angular sector, hence appears completely on the boundary of the union of the n = k + m balls, and it is replicated m times, once for each of the balls Bj , j = 1, . . . , m. It follows that the union of all the balls Bifor i = 1, . . . , k + m has quadratic complexity Ω(km). Moreover, all the balls contain the origin. The union of the n balls is depicted on Figure 3. The proofs involve only elementary geometry and trigonometry. The situation is depicted in Figure 4 and 5. Figure 4 depicts a section in the xz-plane of the spheres ∂Bi and ∂Bk+1 and the point M, the highest point of intersection of the bounding spheres. The point M is also depicted on Figure 2. Proof of Claim 1. It suffices to prove that M is higher than Pk, since then γ extends higher than Pk as well and passes through M by symmetry. The lowest point of γ belongs to B1 and is clearly below the origin. The two facts together prove that γ must intersect all the balls between B1 and Bk. 2Bk B ≤ 2π n x z y Bk+ M γ Figure 2: The union S 1≤i≤k Bi ∪ Bk+1. The curve γ consists of a portion that belongs to B1 and of another portion which is contained in a dihedral sector of angle less than π/m. Let H be the point in the xz-plane on the median bisector of R and Pk, with same z-ordinate as Pk. (See Figure 4.) In order to prove that M is higher than Pk, it suffices to prove that H belongs to Bk, since then M is farther along the bisector. The two triangles QPkH and KRPk have equal angles, hence they are similar. It follows that PkH = PkR PkQ RK = PkR 2RK = x 2 + (z − zk) 2x , (1) where zk = k− n4 . For x and z as given in the construction, we have PkH = 1/ −40 n 4 − 15 n2 + 68 + 16 n6 − 16 n3 + 28 n n4(n2 − 2) which is smaller than 1 for n ≥ 2. Proof of Claim 2. It is easy to see that the intersection of γ and a ball Bi (2 ≤ i ≤ k) consists of at most two arcs of circle, any of which is monotone in angular coordinates around the z-axis, and that any such arc is entirely above the plane z = 0. Hence the intersections of γ with the xy-plane belong to B1 and Bk+1. It suffices to show that these intersections are at a distance ℓ at most n ≤ sin πm from the x-axis. (See Figure 5.) In the xy-plane section, B1 is a unit circle, and Bk+1 is a circle of radius r = √ 1 − z 2 and center R′ of coordinates (x, 0). (Recall that the center of Bk+1 has coordinates (x, 0, z).) Hence ℓ is the height of a triangle with base x and sides 1 and r < 1. It is elementary to compute that ℓ = s 1 − z 2 + x 2x . (2) 3Bk Bk+ B Bk+m Bk+2 Bk+ x y z Figure 3: The union ∪1≤i≤k+mBi.

      "1 Introduction Let G be an undirected simple graph with vertex set V (G) = {v1, . . . , vn} and edge set E(G), where e(G) is the number of edges of G. The adjacency matrix A(G) = (aij ) of G is the n × n matrix, where aij = 1 if viis adjacent to vj , and otherwise. The spectral radius of G is the largest eigenvalue of A(G), denoted by ρ(G), while the least eigenvalue of A(G) is denoted by λn(G). For v ∈ V (G), the neighborhood NG(v) of v is {u : uv ∈ E(G)} and the degree dG(v) of v is |NG(v)|. We write N(v) and d(v) for NG(v) and dG(v) respectively if there is no ambiguity. A path of order n is denoted by Pn. For V1, V2 ⊆ V (G), e(V1, V2) denotes the number of the edges of G with one end vertex in V1 and the other in V2. A graph G is said F-free if it does not contain F as a subgraph. A linear forest is a forest whose connected components are paths. For a path P3 of order 3, say xyz, we call y its center and x, z its two ends. For two vertex disjoint graphs G and H, we denote by G∪H and G∨H the union of G and H, and the join of G and H, i.e., joining every vertex of G to every vertex of H, respectively. Denote by k · G the k disjoint union of G. For graph notation and terminology undefined here, we refer the readers to [2]. ∗This work is supported by the Joint NSFC-ISF Research Program (jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Israel Science Foundation (No. 11561141001)) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.11531001) †Corresponding author. E-mail: xiaodong@sjtu.edu.cn 1The problem of maximizing the number of edges over all graphs without containing fixed subgraphs is one of the cornerstones of graph theory. In 2010, Nikiforov [17] proposed the following spectral extremal graph problem, which is the spectral analogue of Tur´an type extremal problem. Problem 1.1 Given a graph H, what is the maximum ρ(G) of a graph G of order n which does not contain H as a subgraph? On Problem 1.1, Nikiforov has obtained a bulk of work in this spectral analogue of Tur´an type extremal problem. For example, he presented some spectral analogues of classical results in extremal graph theory, such as spectral analogue of Tur´an type theorem [12] and the Erd˝os–Stone–Bollob´as theorem [14]. For more details, readers may be referred to [13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22]. In particular, Nikiforov [17] determined the maximum spectral radius of a graph that does not contain paths of given length as subgraphs and characterized all extremal graphs, which is a spectral analogue of Erd˝os-Gallai theorem (see [6]). A natural extension of this problem is to determine the maximum spectral radius of graphs without containing a linear forest. Lidick´y, Liu, and Palmer [9] determined the Tur´an number for a forbidden linear forest except for k ·P3 if the order of graph is sufficiently large and characterized all extremal graphs. Bushaw and Kettle [3], Campos and Lopes [4], and Yuan and Zhang [20], independently, determined the Tur´an number for a forbidden k · P3. In order to state these results, we need some symbols for given graphs. For 0 ≤ s ≤ ⌊n− ⌋, let Tn,s be the graph of order n obtained by identifying an end of each of s paths P3 and a vertex of each of n − 2s − 1 paths P2. Clearly, Tn, is a star of order n. For 0 < h < n, let Sn,h be the graph of order n obtained by joining every vertex of the complete graph Kh of order h to every vertex of the complement graph Kn−h of Kn−h, i.e., Sn,h = Kh ∨ Kn−h. Furthermore, let S + n,h be the graph obtained by adding an edge to Sn,h, i.e., S + n,h = K2 ∨ (Kh ∪ Kn−h−2). For 1 ≤ k < n, let Fn,k := Kk−1 ∨ (pK2 ∪ Ks), where n − (k − 1) = 2p + s and 0 ≤ s < 2. In particular, Fn,1 = pK2 ∪ Ks. Theorem 1.2 [9] Let F be a linear forest, i.e., F = ∪ k i=1Pai , with k ≥ 2, a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ak ≥ 2, and h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋ − 1. If there exists at least one ai not 3 and G is an F-free graph of order n, then for sufficiently large n, e(G) ≤ h + h(n − h) + c, where c = 1 if all ai are odd and c = 0 otherwise. Moreover, If c = 1 then equality holds if and only if G = S + n,h. Otherwise, the equality holds if and only if G = Sn,h. 2Theorem 1.3 [3, 4, 20] Let G be a k · P3-free graph of order n. Then e(G) ≤    n , for n < 3k; 3k − + ⌊ n−3k+ ⌋, for 3k ≤ n < 5k − 1; 3k − + k, for n = 5k − 1; k − + (n − k + 1)(k − 1) + ⌊ n−k+ ⌋, for n > 5k − 1. Moreover, (i) If n < 3k, then equality holds if and only if G = Kn; (ii) If 3k ≤ n < 5k − 1, then equality holds if and only if G = K3k−1 ∪ Fn−3k+1,1; (iii) If n = 5k−1, then equality holds if and only if G = K3k−1∪F2k,1 or G = F5k−1,k; (iv) If n > 5k − 1, then equality holds if and only if G = Fn,k. Motivated by Problem 1.1 and above results, we determine the maximum spectral radius of all graphs without a linear forest and characterize all extremal graphs. In addition, we also determine the maximum number of edges and spectral radius of bipartite graphs which do not contain k · P3 as a subgraph and characterize all extremal graphs. The main results of this paper are stated as follows. Theorem 1.4 Let F be a linear forest, i.e., F = ∪ k i=1Pai with k ≥ 2 and a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ak ≥ 2. Denote h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋ − 1 and suppose that G is an F-free graph of sufficiently large order n. (i) If there exists an even ai, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Sn,h) with equality if and only if G = Sn,h; (ii) If all ai are odd and there exists at least one ai > 3, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(S + n,h) with equality if and only if G = S + n,h. (iii) If all ai are 3, i.e., F = k · P3, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Fn,k) with equality if and only if G = Fn,k. Theorem 1.5 Let G be a k ·P3-free bipartite graph of order n ≥ 11k−4 with k ≥ 2. Then e(G) ≤ (k − 1)(n − k + 1). Moreover, if k = 2 then equality holds if and only if G = Tn,s, s = 0, 1, . . . , ⌊ n− ⌋; if k ≥ 3 then equality holds if and only if G = Kk−1,n−k+1. Theorem 1.6 Let G be a k ·P3-free bipartite graph of order n ≥ 11k−4 with k ≥ 2. Then ρ(G) ≤ p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if G = Kk−1,n−k+1. Corollary 1.7 Let G be a k · P3-free graph of order n ≥ 11k − 4 with k ≥ 2. Then λn(G) ≥ −p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if G = Kk−1,n−k+1. 3The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some known results and lemmas are presented. In Sections 3 and 4, we present the proof of Theorems 1.4, 1.5, and Theorem 1.6 and Corollary 3.3, respectively. In Section 5, some relations between the Tur´an theorem and spectral Tur´an theorem are discussed. 2 Preliminary In this section, we present some known results. Theorem 2.1 [8, 11] Let G be a graph of order n with the minimum degree δ = δ(G) and e = e(G). Then ρ(G) ≤ δ − 1 + p 8e − 4δn + (δ + 1) . It is easy to see that for 2e ≤ n(n − 1), the function f(x) = x − 1 + p 8e − 4xn + (x + 1) is decreasing with respect to x [11]. Theorem 2.2 [1] Let G be a bipartite graph. Then ρ(G) ≤ p e(G), with equality if and only if G is a disjoint union of a complete bipartite graph and isolated vertices. Lemma 2.3 [17] (i) For h ≥ 1 and n > h, ρ(Sn,h) = h−1+√ 4hn−(3h2+2h−1) . (ii) For h ≥ 2 and n ≥ h , ρ(S + n,h) < h−1+√ 4hn−(3h2+2h−3) . The following lemma is a little different from its original form[17, Lemma 14], but it can be seen from its original proof. Lemma 2.4 [17] Let c ≥ 0, h ≥ 2, n ≥ 4h , and let G be a graph of order n. If δ(G) < h and ρ(G) ≥ h − 1 + √ 4hn − 4h2 + c , then there exists a subgraph H of order p ≥ ⌊√ n⌋ satisfying one of the following conditions: (i) p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p; (ii) p > √ n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h−1+√ 4hp−4h2+c+ . Lemma 2.5 (i)If n − k + 1 is even, then ρ(Fn,k) = k−1+√ 4(k−1)n−(3k 2−2k−5) . (ii) If n − k + 1 is odd, then ρ is the largest root of x 3 − (k − 1)x2 − [(k − 1)n − (k2 − k − 1)]x + k − 1 = 0. (iii) k−1+√ 4(k−1)n−(3k 2−2k−1) 2 < ρ(Fn,k) ≤ k−1+√ 4(k−1)n−(3k 2−2k−5) . 4Proof. Denote ρ = ρ(Fn,k). Let x be a positive eigenvector of A(Fn,k) corresponding to ρ. Let n−(k−1) = 2p+s with 0 ≤ s < 2. By symmetry, all vertices of subgraphs Kk−1, pK2, or Ks in Fn,k = Kk−1∨(pK2∪Ks) have the same eigenvector components respectively, which are denoted by x1, x2, x3, respectively. (i) If n − k + 1 is even, then s = 0. By Ax = ρx, it is easy to see that ρx1 = (k − 2)x1 + (n − k + 1)x2, ρx2 = (k − 1)x1 + x2. It is easy to see that ρ = k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 5) . (ii) If n − k + 1 is odd, then s = 1. By Ax = ρx, it is easy to see that ρx1 = (k − 2)x1 + (n − k)x2 + x3, ρx2 = (k − 1)x1 + x2, ρx3 = (k − 1)x1. Hence we have ρ 3 − (k − 1)ρ2 − [(k − 1)n − (k2 − k − 1)]ρ + k − 1 = 0. Therefore ρ is the largest root of x 3−(k−1)x2−[(k−1)n−(k2−k−1)]x+k−1 = 0. In addition, ρ 2 − (k − 1)ρ − [(k − 1)n − (k2 − k − 1)] = − k − ρ < 0, which implies that ρ < k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 5) . Moreover, noting that ρ > ρ(Kk) = k − 1, we have ρ 2 − (k − 1)ρ − [(k − 1)n − (k2 − k)] = ρ − (k − 1) ρ > 0, which implies that ρ > k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 1) . 3 Proof of Theorem 1. In order to prove Theorem 1.4, we first prove the following three lemmas. Lemma 3.1 Let F be a linear forest, i.e., F = ∪ k i=1Pai with k ≥ 2 and a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ak ≥ 2. Denote h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋−1 and suppose that G is an F-free graph of sufficiently large order n. If there exists an even ai, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Sn,h) with equality if and only if G = Sn,h. 5Proof. Let G be an F-free graph of order n with the maximum spectral radius. Set δ = δ(G) and e = e(G). Since Sn,h is F-free, by Lemma 2.3 (i) we have ρ(G) ≥ ρ(Sn,h) = h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h2 + 2h − 1) . First we assume that h = 1. Then F = 2 · P2 or F = P2 ∪ P3. Obviously ρ(G) ≥ √ n − 1. By [17, Theorem 2], G contains a P4 unless G = Sn,1. Note that G is F-free. If F = 2 · P2, then G = Sn,1. If F = P2 ∪ P3, then G must be P4 ∪ Kn−4 or Sn,1. However, ρ(P4 ∪ Kn−4) < 2 ≤ √ n − 1. Thus G = Sn,1. So we now assume that h ≥ 2 and consider the following two cases. Case 1: δ ≥ h. By Theorem 2.1, ρ(G) ≤ δ − 1 + p 8e − 4δn + (δ + 1) ≤ h − 1 + p8e − 4hn + (h + 1) . Thus e ≥ hn − h 2+h 2 = e(Sn,h). Note that G is F-free. By Theorem 1.2, G = Sn,h. Case 2: δ < h. Note that ρ(G) ≥ h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h 2 + 2h − 1) = h − 1 + p4hn − 4h 2 + (h − 1) . By Lemma 2.4, there exists a graph H of order p such that either p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p; or p > √n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h2 + (h − 1) . If p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p, then 2e(H) = tr(A (H)) ≥ ρ (H) > (2h + 1)p > 2e(Sp,h). By Theorem 1.2, G contains F as a subgraph, which is a contradiction. So we now assume that p > √n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h 2 + (h − 1) . Applying Theorem 2.1 again, we have ρ(H) ≤ h − 1 + p 8e(H) − 4hp + (h + 1) . Hence e(H) > hp − h 2+h 2 = e(Sp,h). By Theorem 1.2, H contains F as a subgraph, which is a contradiction. So we finish the proof. 6Lemma 3.2 Let F be a linear forest, i.e., F = ∪ k i=1Pai with k ≥ 2 and a1 ≥ · · · ≥ ak ≥ 2. Denote h = P k i= ⌊ ai ⌋ − 1 and suppose that G is an F-free graph of sufficiently large order n. If all ai are odd and there exists at least one ai > 3, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(S + n,h) with equality if and only if G = S + n,h. Proof. Let G be an F-free graph of order n with maximum spectral radius. Set δ = δ(G) and e = e(G). Since S + n,h is F-free, by Lemma 2.3 (i) we have ρ(G) ≥ ρ(S + n,h) > ρ(Sn,h) = h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h2 + 2h − 1) . We consider the following two cases. Case 1: δ ≥ h. By Theorem 2.1, we have ρ(G) ≤ δ − 1 + p 8e − 4δn + (δ + 1) ≤ h − 1 + p8e − 4hn + (h + 1) . Hence e ≥ hn − h 2+h 2 + 1 = e(S + n,h). Note that G is F-free. By Theorem 1.2, G = S + n,h. Case 2: δ < h. Note that ρ(G) > h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h 2 + 2h − 1) = h − 1 + p4hn − 4h 2 + (h − 1) . By Lemma 2.4, there exists a graph H of order p such that either p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p; or p > √n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h2 + (h − 1)2 + . If p = ⌊ √ n⌋ and ρ(H) > p (2h + 1)p, then 2e(H) = tr(A (H)) ≥ ρ (H) > (2h + 1)p > 2e(S + p,h). By Theorem 1.2, G contains F as a subgraph, which is a contradiction. Now we assume that p > √ n, δ(H) ≥ h and ρ(H) > h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h2 + (h − 1)2 + = h − 1 + p4hp − (3h2 + 2h − 3) . By Lemma 2.3, ρ(H) > ρ(S + p,h). On the other hand, by Theorem 2.1 and δ(H) ≥ h, we have h − 1 + p 4hp − 4h 2 + (h − 1)2 + < ρ(H) ≤ δ(H) − 1 + p 8e(H) − 4δ(H)p + (δ(H) + 1) ≤ h − 1 + p 8e(H) − 4hp + (h + 1) . Therefore, e(H) > hp − h 2+h 2 + . So e(H) ≥ e(S + p,h). By Theorem 1.2 and H being F-free, we have H = S + p,h, which contradicts to ρ(H) > ρ(S + p,h). This completes the proof. 7Lemma 3.3 Let G be a k · P3-free graph of order n ≥ 8k 2 − 3k with k ≥ 2. Then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Fn,k) with equality if and only if G = Fn,k. Proof. Let G be a k ·P3-free graph of order n with maximum spectral radius. Since Fn,k is k · P3-free, we have ρ(G) ≥ ρ(Fn,k). We first prove the following claim. Claim: There exists a vertex u ∈ V (G) such that d(u) ≥ k and X v∈N(u) d(v) ≥ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1). Suppose that P v∈N(u) d(v) ≤ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k) for all u ∈ V (G). Let B = A2(G) − (k − 1)A(G) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k)]I and Bu be the row sum of B on u, where I is an identity matrix. Then ρ(B) = ρ (G) − (k − 1)ρ(G) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k)]. On the other hand, by [5, Lemma 2.1], ρ(B) ≤ max u∈V (G) Bu = max u∈V (G) X v∈N(u) d(v) − (k − 1)d(u) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k)] ≤ 0. Hence ρ(G) is no more than the largest root of x 2−(k−1)x−[(k−1)n−(k2−k)] = 0, i.e., ρ(G) ≤ k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 1) , which contradicts to ρ(G) > k−1+√4(k−1)n−(3k 2−2k−1) by Lemma 2.5 (iii). In addition, since 0 ≤ X v∈N(u) d(v) − (k − 1)d(u) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] ≤ d(u)(n − 1) − (k − 1)d(u) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] = d(u)(n − k) − (k − 1)(n − k) − < (d(u) − k + 1)(n − k), we have d(u) > k − 1, i.e., d(u) ≥ k. So the claim holds. Next we consider the following two cases. Case 1: k ≤ d(u) ≤ 3k − 2. Let W = V (G)\\({u} ∪ N(u)) and C ⊆ N(u) be the vertex subset such that every vertex in C has at least 2k neighbours in W. We claim that |C| = k − 1. Indeed, if |C| ≥ k then we can embed k · P3 with all centers in C and all ends in W into G, a contradiction. If |C| ≤ k − 2, then we have X v∈N(u) d(v) = X v∈C d(v) + X v∈N(u)\\C d(v) ≤ |C|(n − 1) + (d(u) − |C|)(2k − 1 + d(u)) = (n − d(u) − 2k)|C| + (2k + d(u) − 1)d(u) ≤ (n − d(u) − 2k)(k − 2) + (2k + d(u) − 1)d(u) ≤ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − [n − 3k(3k − 2) + k2 − 3k + 1] = (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − (n − 8k2 + 3k + 1) < (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1), 8which contradicts the claim. So |C| = k − 1. Since |C| = k−1, we can also embed (k−1)·P3 with all centers in C and all ends in W into G−u. Denote by S 1≤i≤k−1 Qi the (k−1)·P3 embedded into G−u, where Qi = xiyizi, yi ∈ C, xi, zi ∈ W for 1 ≤ i ≤ k−1. We claim that d(u) = k. Otherwise S 1≤i≤k−1 Qi together with a disjoint P3 with center u and two ends in N(u)\\C will yield k · P3, a contradiction. Then there exists exactly one vertex yk ∈ N(u) \\ C. Let W1 = {x1, . . . , xk−1, z1, . . . , zk−1}. We claim that yk has no neighbours in W. Otherwise, if yk has a neighbour, say z, in W\\W1 then S 1≤i≤k−1 Qi together with a disjoint P3 with center yk and two ends u, z yield k · P3, a contradiction. If yk has a neighbour in W1, without loss of generality, say x1, then S 2≤i≤k−1 Qi together with zy1z1 and uykx1 will yield k · P3, where z is a neighbour of y1 in W\\W1. It is a contradiction. This implies that N(yk) ⊆ N(u) ∪ {u} and d(yk) ≤ k. By Claim, 0 ≤ X v∈N(u) d(v) − (k − 1)d(u) − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] = X k− i= d(yi) + d(yk) − (k − 1)k − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] ≤ (k − 1)(n − 1) + k − (k − 1)k − [(k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1)] = 0, implying that d(y1) = · · · = d(yk) = (n−1), d(yk) = k, and N(yk) = {u, y1, . . . , yk}. Since G is k · P3-free, G − {u, y1, . . . , yk} is P3-free. So G − {u, y1, . . . , yk} consists of independent edges and isolated vertices, which implies that G ⊆ Fn,k. Then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Fn,k), which implies that ρ(G) = ρ(Fn,k). By the Perron Fronbenius theorem and the extremality of G, we have G = Fn,k. Case 2: d(u) ≥ 3k − 1. Then G[N(u)] must be (k − 1)P3-free. Otherwise, (k − 1) · P3 in G[N(u)] and a disjoint P3 with center u and two ends in N(u) will yield k·P3, a contradiction. Similarly, G−u is also (k−1)·P3-free. By Theorem 1.3, e(N(u)) ≤    3k − + j d(u)−3k+ k , for 3k − 1 ≤ d(u) ≤ 5k − 6; k − + (d(u) − k + 2)(k − 2) + j d(u)−k+ k , for d(u) > 5k − 6; and e(G − u) ≤ k − + (n − k + 1)(k − 2) + n − k + . If 3k − 1 ≤ d(u) ≤ 5k − 6, then X v∈N(u) d(v) ≤ d(u) + e(N(u)) + e(G − u) ≤ d(u) + 3k − + d(u) − 3k + + k − + (n − k + 1)(k − 2) + n − k + ≤ d(u) + d(u) + 9k 2 − 30k + + (2k − 3)(n − 1) − k 2 + 2k 9= (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − n + (2k − 5)d(u) − 10k 2 + 32k − ≤ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − n + (2k − 5)(3k − 1) − 10k 2 + 32k − = (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − n − 4k 2 + 15k − < (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1), which contradicts to the claim. If d(u) > 5k − 6, then X v∈N(u) d(v) ≤ d(u) + e(N(u)) + e(G − {u}) ≤ d(u) + k − + (d(u) − k + 2)(k − 2) + d(u) − k + + k − + (n − k + 1)(k − 2) + n − k + ≤ d(u) + (2k − 3)d(u) − k 2 + 2k + (2k − 3)(n − 1) − k 2 + 2k = (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − n − d(u) + 2k − ≤ (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1) − k < (k − 1)d(u) + (k − 1)n − (k 2 − k − 1), which also contradicts to the claim. This completes the proof. Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.4. Proof. Theorem 1.4 directly follows from Lemmas 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. 4 Proofs of Theorems 1.5, 1.6, and Corollary 1. In this section, we will prove Theorems 1.5, 1.6, and Corollary 1.7. Proof of Theorem 1.5: Let G be a k ·P3-free bipartite graph of order n ≥ 11k − with the maximum number of edges. Since Kk−1,n−k+1 is k · P3-free, we have e(G) ≥ e(Kk−1,n−k+1) = (k − 1)(n − k + 1). We will prove the assertion by induction on k. If k = 2, then e(G) ≥ n − 1. Then G contains P3 as a subgraph. Otherwise G consists of independent edges and isolated vertices and so e(G) ≤ n 2 < n − 1, a contradiction. Clearly, every connected bipartite graph of order at least 3 contains P3 as a subgraph. Since G is 2 · P3-free, G has exactly one connected component H of order p ≥ 3 and any of the remaining components (if any exists) is either an edge or an isolated vertex. Then H is 2 · P3-free and e(H) ≥ e(G) − jn − p k ≥ n − 1 − n − p = n + p − . If 3 ≤ p ≤ 4, then e(H) ≥ 10. If p ≥ 5, then e(H) ≥ 11. Let Q = v1v2 · · · vl be the longest path of order l in H. Since P3 ⊆ H and H is 2·P3-free, we have 3 ≤ l ≤ 5. If l = 3, then H is a star Tp,0. On the other hand, e(G) ≥ n−1. Hence G = H = Tn,0. 10If l = 4, then V (H)\\V (Q) is an independent set and all vertices in V (H)\\V (Q) are adjacent to precisely one of v2 and v3. Hence H = Tp,1. On the other hand, e(G) ≥ n − 1. Then G = H = Tn,1. If l = 5, then H − V (Q) consists of independent edges and isolated vertices, say u1v1, . . . , uqvq, w1, . . . , wr, where q + r ≥ 1, in which each vertex has at most one neighbor, which is v3, in Q. Since H is a bipartite graph without containing 2 · P3, it is easy to see that H = Tp,s, where 2 ≤ s ≤ ⌊ p− ⌋. On the other hand, e(G) ≥ n − 1. Then G = H = Tn,s, 2 ≤ s ≤ ⌊n− ⌋. This completes the proof for k = 2. Suppose that the assertion holds for k − 1 ≥ 2. Since e(G) ≥ (k − 1)(n − k + 1) > (k − 2)(n − k + 2), By the induction hypothesis, we have (k −1)·P3 ⊆ G. We have the following claim. Claim 1: There exist k − 1 vertices in G with degree at least 3k − 1. In fact, take each P3 = xyz in (k−1)·P3. Then G−V (P3) must be (k−1)P3-free, since G is k·P3−free. By the induction hypothesis, e(G−V (P3)) ≤ (k−2)(n−k+2). Moreover, e(G[P3]) = 2 since G is bipartite. Hence e(V (P3), V (G)\\V (P3)) = e(G) − e(G − V (P3)) − e(G[P3]) ≥ (k − 1)(n − k + 1) − (k − 2)(n − k + 2) − = n − 2k + 1. Then there exists a vertex in P3 = xyz with degree at least n−2k+ 3 ≥ 3k − 1. Therefore, for (k −1)·P3, there exist k −1 vertices with degree at least 3k −1. This finishes the proof of Claim 1. Let U be a set of k−1 vertices in G with degree at least 3k−1. Then G−U is P free, i.e., G−U consists of independent edges and isolated vertices. Otherwise the P in G−U and other (k −1)·P3 with all centers in U and all ends in V (G−U)\\V (P3) will yield k · P3 in G since each vertex in U has degree at least 3k − 1. Further we have the following claim. Claim 2: U is an independent set. Suppose that U is not an independent set. Since G is bipartite, G[U] has a bipartition U = U1 ∪ U2 with e(U1, U2) ≥ 1. On the other hand, G − U has also a bipartition V (G − U) = W1 ∪ W2 with |W1| ≤ |W2|. Without loss of generality, G has a bipartition V (G) = (U1 ∪ W1) ∪ (U2 ∪ W2). Then e(G) = e(U1, U2) + e(W1, W2) + e(U1, W2) + e(U2, W1) ≤ |U1||U2| + |W1| + |U1||W2| + |U2||W1| < |W2||U2| + |U1||W1| + |U1||W2| + |U2||W1| = (|U1| + |U2|)(|W1| + |W2) = (k − 1)(n − k + 1), where the first inequality holds because G − U consists of independent edges and isolated vertices and |W1| ≤ |W2|, the second inequality holds because 1 ≤ |U1| ≤ k − 2 ≤ n−k+ 2 ≤ |W2|. This contradicts to e(G) ≥ (k − 1)(n − k + 1). Hence Claim 2 holds. In addition, we have the following Claim 3. Claim 3: V (G − U) is an independent set. 11Since G−U is P3-free, G−U consists of independent edges and isolated vertices. Suppose that there is an edge uv in G − U. Since G is a bipartite graph, u and v has no common neighbours in U. Then d(u) + d(v) ≤ k − 1. Then e(G) ≤ e({u, v}) + e({u, v}, V (G) − {u, v}) + e(G − {u, v}) ≤ 1 + k − 1 + (k − 1)(n − k + 1 − 2) < (k − 1)(n − k + 1). It is a contradiction. So Claim 3 holds. Then G is a bipartite graph with bipartite parts U and V (G) − U. Moreover, |U| = k − 1 and e(G) ≥ (k − 1)(n − k + 1). Therefore G = Kk−1,n−k+1. Proof of Theorem 1.6: Let G be a k · P3-free bipartite graph of order n with maximum spectral radius. Since Kk−1,n−k+1 is k · P3-free, we have ρ(G) ≥ ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1) = p (k − 1)(n − k + 1). By Theorems 2.2 and 1.5, ρ(G) ≤ p e(G) ≤ p (k − 1)(n − k + 1). Then ρ(G) = pe(G) = p(k − 1)(n − k + 1). By Theorem 1.5, G = Kk−1,n−k+1. Proof of Corollary 1.7: By a result of Favaron et al. [7], λn(G) ≥ λn(H) for some spanning bipartite subgraph H. Moreover, the equality holds if and only if G = H, which can be deduced by its original proof. By Theorem 1.6, ρ(H) ≤ p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if H = Kk−1,n−k+1. Since the spectrum of a bipartite graph is symmetry [10], λn(H) ≥ −p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if H = Kk−1,n−k+1. Thus we have λn(G) ≥ −p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) with equality if and only if G = Kk−1,n−k+1. 5 Discussion It is known that if G is a Kr+1-free graph of order n, then e(G) ≤ e(Tn,r) and ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Tn,r) (for example, see [12, 18]), where Tn,r is a complete r-partite graph of order n with partite sets of cardinalities ⌊n/r⌋ or ⌈n/r⌉. Further spectral Tur´an theorem (ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Tn,r)) is a slight better than Tur´an theorem (e(G) ≤ e(Tn,r)). In fact, if ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Tn,r), then e(G) ≤ nρ(G) ≤ nρ(Tn,r) ≤ e(Tn,r). 12But in general, e(G) ≤ e(Tn,r) does not imply that ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Tn,r). On the other hand, from Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, we see that if G is an F-free graph of order n, where F is a linear forest, then the extremal graph maximizing the number of edges is the same as the extremal graph maximizing the spectral radius. Based on the above results, we may propose the following problem. Problem 5.1 For a given graph H, let G be an H-free graph of order n. If the extremal graph maximizing the number of edges is the same as the extremal graph maximizing the spectral radius, say G∗, then what is relations between e(G) ≤ e(G∗) and ρ(G) ≤ ρ(G∗)? Clearly, if G∗is Tn,r, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(G∗) implies that e(G) ≤ e(G∗). But if G∗is the extremal graph for a linear forest F, we give several examples to illustrate that they do not have \"implication\" relation, while if G∗is the bipartite extremal graph for k · P3, they have \"implication\" relation. Example 1: Let G = (Kr ∨ (K1 ∪ Kl−r)) ∪ Kn−l−1, where l + r = hn − h 2+h and 0 ≤ r < l. Then e(G) = hn − h 2 + h = e(Sn,h). Since hn − h 2 + h = l + r < l + < (l + 1) , we have l > p 2hn − h2 − h − 1. Thus ρ(G) ≥ ρ(Kl) = l − 1 > p 2hn − h2 − h − > h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h2 + 2h − 1) = ρ(Sn,h). Then e(G) ≤ e(Sn,h) and ρ(G) > ρ(Sn,h). Example 2: Let G be a 2h-regular graph of large order n. Obviously, ρ(G) = 2h < h − 1 + p 4hn − (3h2 + 2h − 1) = ρ(Sn,h) and e(G) = hn > e(Sn,h). Then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Sn,h) and e(G) > e(Sn,h). Example 3: Let G = (Kr∨(K1∪Kl−r))∪Kn−l−1, where l +r = j (2k−1)n−k 2+ k and 0 ≤ r < l. Then e(G) = (2k − 1)n − k 2 + = e(Fn,k). 13Since (2k − 1)n − k 2 + = l + r < l + < (l + 1) , we have l > p (2k − 1)n − k 2 − 1. Thus ρ(G) ≥ l−1 > p (2k − 1)n − k 2−2 > k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 5) ≥ ρ(Fn,k). Example 4: Let G be a 2k-regular graph of large order n. Obviously, ρ(G) = 2k < k − 1 + p 4(k − 1)n − (3k 2 − 2k − 1) < ρ(Fn,k) and e(G) = kn > (2k − 1)n − k 2 + = e(Fn,k). Proposition 5: Let G be a bipartite graph G of order n. If e(G) ≤ e(Kk−1,n−k+1), then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1). Indeed, by Theorems 2.2 and 1.5, ρ(G) ≤ p e(G) ≤ p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) = ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1). However, ρ(G) ≤ ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1) does not imply that e(G) ≤ e(Kk−1,n−k+1). For example, let G be a 2k-regular bipartite graph of large even order n. Obviously, ρ(G) = 2k < p (k − 1)(n − k + 1) < ρ(Kk−1,n−k+1) and e(G) = kn > (k − 1)(n − k + 1) = e(Fn,k). From above discussion, there is an interesting phenomenon for (spectral) Tur´an type problems. Spectral Tur´an type results imply the corresponding Tur´an type results for some given forbidden graphs, while Tur´an type results imply the corresponding spectral Tur´an type results for other given forbidden graphs,. This phenomenon may be worth to further investigate. References [1] A. Bhattacharya, S. Friedland, U. N. Peled, On the first eigenvalue of bipartite graphs, Electron. J.

      "1 Introduction Handball, a popular sport around the globe, is particularly important in Europe and South America. As there are many different aspects that can be analyzed, in the last years handball had also raised an increasing interests among researchers. For example, in Uhrmeister and Brosig (2018) a group of statisticians and sports scientists selected 59 items from the play-by-play reporting of all games of the 2017 IHF World Men's Handball Championship and the involved players were compared based on their individual game actions independently of game systems, concepts and tactical tricks. The data were clustered and collected in a matrix, to add up to a \"PlayerScore\". In another scientific work, the activity ∗Faculty of Statistics, TU Dortmund University, Vogelpothsweg 87, 44227 Dortmund, Germany, groll@statistik.tu-dortmund.de † jonas.heiner@tu-dortmund.de ‡Chair of Epidemiology, Department of Sport and Health Sciences, Technical University of Munich, g.schauberger@tum.de §Faculty of Sports Sciences, Ruhr-University Bochum, joern.uhrmeister@rub.de second halves of a match were compared (Chelly, Hermassi, Aouadi, Khalifa, Van den Tillaar, Chamari and Shephard, 2011). In this project we elaborate on a statistical model to evaluate the chances for all teams to become champion of the upcoming IHF Handball World Cup in Denmark and Germany. For this purpose, we launched a collaboration of professional statisticians and handball experts. While this task is rather popular for soccer (see, e.g., Groll, Schauberger and Tutz, 2015 or Zeileis, Leitner and Hornik, 2014), to the best of our knowledge this idea is new in handball. In the following, we will compare several (regularized) regression approaches modeling the number of goals the two competing handball teams score in a match regarding their predicitve performances. We start with the classical model for count data, namely the Poisson regression model. Next, we allow for under- or overdispersion, where the latter can be captured by the negative binomial model. Furthermore, as for large values of the Poisson mean λ the corresponding Poisson distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution (with µ = σ 2 = λ) due to the central limit theorem, this inspired us to also apply a Gaussian response model. Through this comparison, a best-performing model is chosen using the mathces of the IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017 as the training data. Based on its estimates, the IHF World Cup 2019 is simulated repeatedly and winning probabilities are calculated for all teams. The rest of the manuscript is structured as follows: in Section 2 we describe the underlying (training) data set covering (almost) all matches of the four preceding IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017. Next, in Section 3 we briefly explain four different regression approaches and compare them based on their predictive performance on the training data set. The best-performing model is then fitted to the data and used to simulate and forecast the IHF World Cup 2019 in Section 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 2 Data In this section, we briefly describe the underlying data set covering all matches of the four preceding IHF World Men's Handball Championships 2011 – together with several potential influence variables1. Basically, we use a similar set of covariates as Groll et al. (2015) do for their soccer FIFA World Cup analysis, with certain modifications that are necessary for handball. For each participating team, the covariates are observed either for the year of the respective World Cup (e.g., GDP per capita) or shortly before the start of the World Cup (e.g., a team's IHF ranking), and, therefore, vary from one World Cup to another. Some of the variables contain information about the recent performance and sportive success of national teams, as the current form of a national team should have an influence on the team's success in the upcoming tournament. Beside 1Principally, a larger data set containing more IHF World Cups together with the belowmentioned covariate information could have been constructed. However, for World Cups earlier than 2011 these data were much harder or impossible to find. For this reason we rerstrict the present analysis on the four IHF World Cup 2011 – 2017. 2these sportive variables, also certain economic factors as well as variables describing the structure of a team's squad are collected. We shall now describe in more detail these variables. Economic Factors: GDP per capita. To account for the general increase of the gross domestic product (GDP) during 2011 – 2017, a ratio of the GDP per capita of the respective country and the worldwide average GDP per capita is used (source: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/ 2018/01/weodata/index.aspx). Population. The population size is used in relation to the respective global population to account for the general world population growth during 2011 – 2017 (source: https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/ Standard/Population/). Sportive factors: ODDSET probability. We convert bookmaker odds provided by the German state betting agency ODDSET into winning probabilities. The variable hence reflects the probability for each team to win the respective World Cup. IHF ranking. The IHF ranking is a ranking table of national handball federations published by the IHF (source: http://ihf.info/en-us/ thegame/rankingtable). The full ranking includes results of men's, women's as well as junior and youth teams and even beach handball. The points a team receives are determined from the final rankings of World Cups of the respective sub-groups and Olympic games and strictly increase over the years, so the ranking system displays an all-time ranking of the national federations. All those results can be regarded totaled or separated for each team's section. Since this project only examines men's World Cups, merely the men's ranking table will be further disposed. IHF points. In addition to the IHF ranking, we also include the precise number of IHF points the ranking is based on. This provides an even more exact all-time ranking of the national federations' historic performances. Home advantage: Host. It can be assumed that the host of a Word Cup might have a home advantage, since the players' experience a stronger crowd support in the arena and are more conversant with the host country's cultural circumstances. Hence, a dummy is included indicating if a national team is a hosting country. Since the World Cup 2019 is jointly hosted by Germany and Denmark, both are treated equally. 3Continental federation. The IHF is the parent organization of the different continental federations, the African Handball Confederation (CAHB), the Asian Handball Federation (AHF), the European Handball Federation (EHF), the Oceania Continent Handball Federation (OCHF) and the Pan-American Team Handball Federation (PATHF). The nation's affiliation to the same continental federation as the host could on the one hand influence the team's performance similar to the Word Cup's host by their better habituation with the host's conventions. Additionally, supporters of those teams have a shorter arrival. On the other, hand handball is not equally prevalent on every continent, especially European club handball is most popular. To capture potential performance differences between the continental federations, two variables are added to the data set. A dummy determining whether a nation is located in Europe, and a dummy seizing whether a nation belongs to the same umbrella organization as the Word Cup host. Factors describing the team's structure: The following variables describe the structure of the teams. They were observed with the 16-player-squad nominated for the respective World Cup. (Second) maximum number of teammates. For each squad, both the maximum and second maximum number of teammates playing together in the same national club are counted. Average age. The average age of each squad is collected. However, very young players might be rather inexperienced at big tournaments and some older players might lack a bit concerning their condition. For this reason we assume an ideal athlete's age, here represented by the average age of all squads that participated in World Cups throughout the last eight years, so that the absolute divergence between a national team's average age and that ideal age is surveyed. Average height. The average height of a team can possibly impact the team's power. Tall players might have an advantage over short players, as they can release a shot on goal above a defender more easily. Therefore, we include the team's average height in meters. Number of EHF Champions League (EHF-cup) players. As club handball is mainly based on the European continent, the EHF Champions League is viewed as the most attractive competition, as numerous of the best club teams in the world participate and only the best manage to reach the final stages of the competition. Hence, also the best players play for these clubs. For this reason we include the number of players of each country that reached the EHF Champions League semifinals in the previous year of the respective World Cup. The same data is collected for the second biggest European club competition, the EHF-cup. 4Number of players abroad/Legionnaires. For each squad, the number of players playing in clubs abroad is counted. Factors describing the team's coach: The players of course extinguish the most important part of a squad, but every team additionally needs an eligible coach to instruct the players. Therefore, some observable trainer characteristics are gathered, namely Age and Tenure of the coach plus a dummy variable that determines whether he shares the same Nationality as his team. In total, this adds up to 18 variables which were collected separately for each World Cup and each participating team. As an illustration, Table 1 shows the results (1a) and (parts of) the covariates (1b) of the respective teams, exemplarily for the first four matches of the IHF World Cup 2011. We use this data excerpt to illustrate how the final data set is constructed. Table 1: Exemplary table showing the results of four matches and parts of the covariates of the involved teams.

For the modeling techniques that we shall introduce in the following sections, all of the metric covariates are incorporated in the form of differences. For example, the final variable Rank will be the difference between the IHF ranks of both teams. The categorical variables Host, Nationality as well as the two continental federation variables, however, are included as separate variables for both competing teams. For the variable Host, for example, this results in two columns of the corresponding design matrix denoted by Host and Host.Oppo, where Host is indicating whether the first-named team is a World Cup host and Host.Oppo whether its opponent is. As we use the number of goals of each team directly as the response variable, each match corresponds to two different observations, one per team. For the covariates, we consider differences which are computed from the perspective of the first-named team. For illustration, the resulting final data structure for the exemplary matches from Table 1 is displayed in Table 2. Due to some missing covariate values for a few games, altogether the final data set contains 334 out of 354 matches from the four handball World Cups 2011 – 2017. Note that in all the models described in the next section, we incorporate all of the above mentioned covariates. However, not all of them will be selected by the introduced penalization technique. Instead, rather sparse models will be prefered. 5Table 2: Exemplary table illustrating the data structure.

Actually, most of them (or slight modifications thereof) have already been used in former research on soccer data and, generally, all yielded satisfactory results. However, some adjustments are necessary for handball. All methods described in this section can be directly applied to data in the format of Table 2 from Section 2. Hence, each score is treated as a single observation and one obtains two observations per match. We aim to choose the approach that has the best performance regarding prediction and then use it to predict the IHF World Men's Handball Championship 2019. 3.1 Poisson model A traditional approach which is often applied, for example, to model soccer results is based on Poisson regression. In this case, the scores of the competing teams are treated as (conditionally) independent variables following a Poisson distribution (conditioned on certain covariates), as introduced in the seminal works of Maher, 1982 and Dixon and Coles, 1997. As already stated, each score from a match of two handball teams is treated as a single observation. Accordingly, similar to the regression approach investogated in Groll, Ley, Schauberger and Van Eetvelde (2018), for n teams the respective model has the form Yi jk|xik, x jk ∼ Po(λi jk), log(λi jk) = ηi jk := β0 + (xik −x jk) >β +z> ikγ +z > jkδ , (1) where Yi jk denotes the score of handball team i against team j in tournament k with i, j ∈ {1,...,n}, i 6= j and ηi jk is the corresponding linear predictor. The metric characteristics of both competing teams are captured in the p-dimensional vectors xik, x jk, while zik and zjk capture dummy variables for the categorical covariates Host, Nationality as well as the two continental federation variables (built, for example, by reference encoding), separately for the considered teams and their respective opponents. For these variables, it is not sensible to build differences between the respective values. Furthermore, β is a parameter vector 6which captures the linear effects of all metric covariate differences and γ and δ collect the effects of the dummy variables corresponding to the teams and their opponents, respectively. For notational convenience, we collect all covariate effects in the ˜p-dimensional real-valued vector θ > = (β > , γ >,δ > ). If, as in our case, several covariates of the competing teams are included into the model it is sensible to use regularization techniques when estimating the models to allow for variable selection and to avoid overfitting. In the following, we will introduce such a basic regularization approach, namely the conventional Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; Tibshirani, 1996). For estimation, instead of the regular likelihood l(β0,θ) the penalized likelihood lp(β0,θ) = l(β0,θ)−ξP(β0,θ) (2) is maximized, where P(β0,θ) = ∑ p˜ v= |θv| denotes the ordinary Lasso penalty with tuning parameter ξ . The optimal value for the tuning parameter ξ will be determined by 10-fold cross-validation (CV). The model will be fitted using the function cv.glmnet from the R-package glmnet (Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani, 2010). In contrast to the similar ridge penalty (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970), which penalizes squared parameters instead of absolute values, Lasso does not only shrink parameters towards zero, but is able to set them to exactly zero. Therefore, depending on the chosen value of the tuning parameter, Lasso also enforces variable selection. 3.2 Overdispersed Poisson model / negative binomial model The Poisson model introduced in the previous section is built on the rather strong assumption E Yi jk|xik, x jk= Var Yi jk|xik, x jk= λi jk, i.e. that the expectation of the distribution equates the variance. For the case of World Cup handball matches, the (marginal) average number of goals is around 30 (for example, y¯ = 27.33 for the matches of the IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017) and supposably the corresponding variance could differ substantially. A case often treated in the literature is the case when Var(Y) > E[Y], the so-called overdispersion. But for handball matches, also the contrary could be possible, namely that Var(Y) < E[Y] holds. In both cases, one typically assumes that Var(Y) = φ ·E[Y] holds, where φ is called dispersion parameter and can be estimated via φˆ = N −d f N ∑ i= r i , (3) where N is the number of observations and rithe model's Pearson residuals. We will first focus on the (more familiar) case of overdispersion. It is well known that the overdispersed Poisson model can be obtained by using the negative binomial model. To combine this model class with the Lasso penalty from equation (2), the cv.glmregNB function from the R-package mpath (Wang, 2018) can be used (see also, for example, Wang, Ma and Wang, 2015). 73.3 Underdispersed Poisson model If we fit the (regularized) Poisson model from Section 3.1 to our IHF World Cup data and then estimate the dispersion parameter via equation (3), we obtain a value for φˆ clearly smaller than one (φˆ = 0.74), i.e. substantial underdispersion. Hence, the variance of the goals in IHF World Cup matches seems to be smaller than their mean. To be able to simulate from an underdispersed Poisson distribution (which we would need later on to simulate matches from the IHF World Cup 2019), the rdoublepois function from the rmutil-package ((Swihart and Lindsey, 2018)) can be used. 3.4 The Gaussian response model It is well-known that for large values of the Poisson mean λ the corresponding Poisson distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution (with µ = σ 2 = λ) due to the central limit theorem. In practice, for values λ ≈ 30 (or larger) the approximation of the Poisson via the Gaussian distribution is already quite satisfactory. As we have already seen in Section 3.2 that the average number of goals in handball World Cup matches is close to 30, this inspired us to also apply a Gaussian response model. However, instead of forcing the mean to equate the variance, we again allow for µ 6= σ , i.e. for potential (constant) over- or underdispersion. Note here that the main difference to the over- and underdispersion models from the two preceding sections is that there each observation obtains its own variance via Var Yi jk|xik, x jk= φˆ · λi jk, where in the Gaussian response model all observations have the same variance σˆ . On our World Cup 2011 – 2017 data, we obtain σˆ 2 = 20.13, which compared to the average number of goals ¯y = 27.33 indicates a certain amount of (constant) underdispersion. We also want to point out here that in order to be able to simulate a precise match result from the model's distribution (and then, successively, to calculate probabilities for the three match results win, draw or loss), we round results to the next natural number. In general, the Lasso-regularized Gaussian response model will again be fitted using the function cv.glmnet from the R-package glmnet based on the linear predictor ηi jk defined in equation (1). 3.5 Increase model sparsity Note that in addition to the conventional Lasso solution minimizing the 10-fold CV error, a second, sparser solution could be used. Here, the optimal value for the tuning parameter ξ is chosen by a different strategy: instead of choosing the model with the minimal CV error the most restrictive model is chosen which is within one standard error of the minimum of the CV error. While it is directly provided by the cv.glmnet function from the glmnet package, for the cv.glmregNB function it had to be calculated manually. In the following section, where all the different models from above are compared, for each model class also this sparser solution is calculated and included in the comparison. 83.6 Comparing methods The four different approaches introduced in Sections 3.1 - 3.4 are now compared with regard to their predictive performance. For this purpose, we apply the following general procedure to the World Cup 2011 – 2017 data which had already been applied to soccer World Cup data in Groll et al. (2018): 1. Form a training data set containing three out of four World Cups. 2. Fit each of the methods to the training data. 3. Predict the left-out World Cup using each of the prediction methods. 4. Iterate steps 1-3 such that each World Cup is once the left-out one. 5. Compare predicted and real outcomes for all prediction methods. This procedure ensures that each match from the total data set is once part of the test data and we obtain out-of-sample predictions for all matches. In step 5, several different performance measures for the quality of the predictions are investigated. Let ˜yi ∈ {1,2,3} be the true ordinal match outcomes for all i = 1,...,N matches from the four considered World Cups. Additionally, let πˆ1i,πˆ2i,πˆ3i, i = 1,...,N, be the predicted probabilities for the match outcomes obtained by one of the different methods introduced in Sections 3.1 - 3.4. Further, let G1i and G2i denote the random variables representing the number of goals scored by two competing teams in match i. Then, the probabilities πˆ1i = P(G1i > G2i),πˆ2i = P(G1i = G2i) and πˆ3i = P(G1i < G2i) can be computed/simulated based on the respective underlying (conditionally) independent response distributions F1i,F2i with G1i ∼ F1i and G2i ∼ F2i. The two distributions F1i,F2i depend on the corresponding linear predictors ηi jk and ηjik from equation (1). Based on these predicted probabilities, following Groll et al. (2018) we use three different performance measures to compare the predictive power of the methods: • the multinomial likelihood, which for a single match outcome is defined as πˆ δ1 ˜yi 1i πˆ δ2 ˜yi 2i πˆ δ3 ˜yi 3i , with δry˜idenoting Kronecker's delta. It reflects the probability of a correct prediction. Hence, a large value reflects a good fit. • the classification rate, based on the indicator functionsI(y˜i = arg max r∈{1,2,3} (πˆri)), indicating whether match i was correctly classified. Again, a large value of the classification rate reflects a good fit. • the rank probability score (RPS) which, in contrast to both measures introduced above, explicitly accounts for the ordinal structure of the responses. For our purpose, it can be defined as 3− 3− ∑ r= r ∑ l= (πˆli −δly˜i) . As the RPS is an error measure, here a low value represents a good fit. 9Odds provided by bookmakers serve as a natural benchmark for these predictive performance measures. For this purpose, we collected the so-called \"three-way\" odds for (almost) all matches of the IHF World Cups 2011 – 20172. By taking the three quantities π˜ri = 1/oddsri,r ∈ {1,2,3}, of a match i and by normalizing with ci:= ∑ r= π˜ri in order to adjust for the bookmaker's margins, the odds can be directly transformed into probabilities using πˆri = π˜ri/ci . As we later want to predict both winning probabilities for all teams and the whole tournament course for the IHF World Cup 2019, we are also interested in the performance of the regarded methods with respect to the prediction of the exact number of goals. In order to identify the teams that qualify during both group stages, the precise final group standings need to be determined. To be able to do so, the precise results of the matches in the group stage play a crucial role4. For this reason, we also evaluate the different regression models' performances with regard to the quadratic error between the observed and predicted number of goals for each match and each team, as well as between the observed and predicted goal difference. Let now yi jk, for i, j = 1,...,n and k ∈ {2011,2013,2015,2017}, denote the observed numbers of goals scored by team i against team j in tournament k and ˆyi jk a corresponding predicted value, obtained by one of the models from Sections 3.1 - 3.4. Then we calculate the two quadratic errors (yi jk−yˆi jk) and (yi jk −y jik)−(yˆi jk −yˆjik) for all N matches of the four IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017. Finally, per method we calculate (mean) quadratic errors. Table 3 displays the results for these five performance measures for the models introduced in Sections 3.1 - 3.4 as well as for the bookmakers, averaged over 334 matches from the four IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017. While the bookmakers serve as a benchmark and yield the best results with respect to all ordinal critera, the second-best method's results are highlighted in bold text. It turns out that the Poisson and the underdispersed Poisson model yield very good results with respect to the classification rate, while the Gaussian response model is (in some cases clearly) the best performer regarding all other criteria. As no overdispersion (and, actually, underdispersion) is found in the data, the negative binomial model's results are almost indistinguishable from those of the (conventional) Poisson model. The more sparse Lasso estimators introduced in Section 3. perform substantially worse in terms of prediction accuracy compared to the conventional Lasso solution. Based on these results, we chose the regularized Gaussian response model with constant (and rather low) variance as our final model and shall use it in the next section to simulate the IHF World Cup 2019. 2Three-way odds consider only the match tendency with possible results victory team 1, draw or defeat team 1 and are usually fixed some days before the corresponding match takes place. The three-way odds were obtained from the website https://www.betexplorer.com/ handball/world/. 3The transformed probabilities implicitely assume that the bookmaker's margins are equally distributed on the three possible match tendencies. 4The final group standings are determined by (1) the number of points, (2) head-to-head points (3) head-to-head goal difference, (4) head-to-head number of goals scored, (5) goal difference and (6) total number of goals. If no distinct decision can be taken, the decision is taken by lot. 10Table 3: Comparison of the different methods for ordinal match outcomes; the second-best method's results are highlighted in bold text.

Odds 0.6688 0.8114 0.1256 - - 4 Prediction of the IHF World Cup Now we apply the best-performing model from Section 3, namely the regularized Gaussian response model with constant underdispersion, to the full World Cup 2011 – 2017 training data and will then use it to calculate winning probabilities for the World Cup 2019. For this purpose, the covariate information from Section 2 has to be collected for all teams participating at the 2019 World Cup. It has to be stated that at the time this analysis has been performed, namely at the first tournament day (June 10, 2019) right before the start of the tournament, the teams of Bahrein and Sweden had listed squads consisting of 15 players only and there will probably be one more player moving up soon. Hence, for those two teams the covariates corresponding to natural-numbered team structure variables (such as, e.g., the number of legionnaires) have been normalized to be comparable to 16-player squads by multiplying them with the factor 16/15. Another special case concerns the team of Korea. As this team is fromed by a selection of players from both South and North Korea, the federation was given the special approval to nominate 20 players. As it actually might be an advantage to have a larger squad we abstained here from normalizing the covariate values from the Korean team. The optimal tuning parameter ξ of the L1-penalized Gaussian response model, which minimizes the deviance shown in Figure 1 (left), leads to a model with (out of possibly 22) regression coefficients different from zero. The paths illustrated in Figure 1 (right) show that three covariates enter the model rather early. These are the Rank, the Height and the Odds, which seem to be rather important when determining the score in a handball World Cup match. The corresponding fixed effects estimates for the (scaled) covariates are shown in Table 4. 110.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1. 22 24 26 28 30 log(ξ + 1) Deviance log(ξopt + 1) = 0. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1. −2.0 −1.0 0.0 1. log(ξ + 1) βj ^ log(ξopt + 1) = 0.

Next, we can simulate all resulting matches in the main round and determine those teams that reach the semi-finals and, finally, those two teams that reach the final and the World Champion. We repeat the simulation of the whole tournament 100,000 times. This way, for each of the 24 participating teams probabilities to reach the different tournament stages and, finally, to win the tournament are obtained. 124.1 Probabilities for IHF World Cup 2019 Winner For each match in the World Cup 2019, the model can be used to predict an expected number of goals for both teams. Given the expected number of goals, a real result is drawn by assuming two (conditionally) independent Gaussian distributions for both scores, which are then rounded to the closest natural number. Based on these results, all 60 matches from the preliminary round can be simulated and final group standings can be calculated. Due to the fact that real results are simulated, we can precisely follow the official IHF rules when determining the final group standings (see footnote 4). This enables us to determine the matches in the main round and we can continue by simulating those matches. Again, if the final group standings are calculated, the semi-final is determined. Next, the semi-final can be simulated and the final is determined. In the case of draws in \"knockout\" matches, we simulate extra-time by a second simulated result. However, here we multiply the expected number of goals by the factor 1/ to account for the shorter time to score (10 min instead of 60 min). In the case of a further draw in the first extra-time, we repeat this procedure. If the second extra time still ends in a draw we simulate the penalty shootout by a (virtual) coin flip. Following this strategy, a whole tournament run can be simulated, which we repeat 100,000 times. Based on these simulations, for each of the 24 participating teams probabilities to reach (at least) the main round or the given final rank and, finally, to win the tournament are obtained. These are summarized in Table 5 together with the winning probabilities based on the ODDSET odds for comparison. Apparently, the resulting winning probabilities show some discrepancies from the probabilities based on the bookmaker's odds. Though the upper and lower half of the teams according to our calculated probabilities seem to coincide quite well with the overall ranking according to the bookmaker's odds, for single teams from the upper half, in particular, Denmark, Spain and Hungary, the differences between our approach and the bookmaker are substantial. Based on our model, Denmark is the clear favorite for becoming IHF World Champion 2019. These discrepancies could be mostly explained by the fact that the Lasso coefficient estimates from Table 4 include several other covariate effects beside the bookmaker's odds. 4.2 Group rankings Finally, based on the 100,000 simulations, we also provide for each team the probability to reach the main round. The results together with the corresponding probabilities are presented in Table 6. Obviously, there are large differences with respect to the groups' balances. While the model forecasts for example Spain and Croatia in Group B, Denmark and Norway in Group C and Hungary and Sweden in Group D with probabilities clearly larger than 90% to reach the second group stage, in Group A France followed by Germany are the main favorites, but with lower probabilities of 89.05% and 80.16%, respectively. Hence, Group A seems to be more volatile. 13Table 5: Estimated probabilities (in %) for reaching (at least) the main round or the given final ranks in the IHF World Cup 2019 for all 24 teams based on 100,000 simulation runs of the IHF World Cup together with winning probabilities based on the ODDSET odds.

We chose the Gaussian response model with constant and rather low variance (indicating a tendency of underdispersion) as our final model as the most promising candidate and fitted it to a training data set containing all matches of the four previous IHF World Cups 2011 – 2017. Based on the corresponding estimates, we repeatedly simulated the IHF World Cup 2019 100,000 times. According to these simulations, the teams from Denmark (37.2%) and France (19.4%) turned out to be the top favorites for winning the title, with a clear advantage for Denmark. 14Table 6: Probabilities for all teams to reach the main round at the IHF World Cup 2019 based on 100,000 simulation runs.

      "1 Introduction The famous six Painlev´e equations play a significant role in modern mathematical physics. The interest in their non-commutative extensions was motivated by the needs of modern quantum physics as well as by natural attempts of mathematicians to extend \"classical\" structures to the non-commutative case. In the paper [14], the Painlev´e equations were written as polynomial systems of the form    f(z) du dz = P1(u, v) + z Q1(u, v), f(z) dv dz = P2(u, v) + z Q2(u, v), (1) where f(z) = z(z − 1) for the P6 system, f(z) = z in the P5 and P3 cases and f(z) = for remaining types of Painlev´e systems. The right-hand sides of systems depend on several arbitrary parameters κi. We consider systems of the form (1), where Pi , Qi are polynomials with constant scalar coefficients in non-commutative variables u and v. For simplicity, we regard these variables as matrices of an arbitrary size m . We assume that if m = 1 then the system (1) coincides with one of the six Painlev´e systems P1 − P6. Some examples of integrable non-abelian systems of the form (1) are contained in [12, 4, 3, 7, 15, 1, 2]. Some of them were found using the existence of special isomonodromy representations or the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test while several of the systems have been derived from integrable PDEs and lattices by reductions. Classification papers [4, 3, 7] devoted to systems of P1, P2, and P4 were based on the matrix Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test. Unfortunately, for the P3, P5, and P6 systems this approach turns out to be too laborious. Мoreover, in this approach it is essential that the variables u and v are matrices. In [6] a different integrability criterion based on the existence of a non-abelian Okamoto integral was used. As a result, a collection of new non-abelian systems of P3, P5, and P6 type was obtained. However, some of known non-abelian systems do not have the Okamoto integral. ∗National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation. †L.D. Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Chernogolovka, Russian Federation. 1Using the non-abelian formalism (see, for example, [13]), all considerations can be trivially generalized to the non-abelian case. For this reason, in this paper we do not distinguish \"matrix\" and \"non-abelian\" systems. 1In this paper we propose an approach related to properties of the autonomous system    du dt = P1(u, v) + z Q1(u, v), dv dt = P2(u, v) + z Q2(u, v), (2) obtained from system (1) by freezing the independent variable. In system (2) we treat z as a parameter. We call system (2) the auxiliary autonomous system for (1). Our classification of integrable non-abelian Painlev´e systems (1) is based on the following Assumption 1. The corresponding auxiliary system is supposed to be integrable. This means that: 1. System (2) has a Lax representation Lt = [M, L] (3) with a spectral parameter. 2. It has infinitely many polynomial non-abelian infinitesimal symmetries commuting with each other. Each of these symmetries has a Lax representation of the form (3) with the same operator L (but with different operator M). 3. All systems of this hierarchy have the same set of first integrals defined by trace (L i ). 4. The Lax operators, first integrals, and symmetries coincide with the corresponding components of the scalar hierarchy when the size m of matrices is equal to one. It turns out that known examples of non-abelian Painlev´e systems satisfy some of these conditions (for P1 and P2 see [8]). The hierarchy of Assumption 1 can be obtained from the trivial hierarchy of the scalar auxiliary system by the non-abelianization procedure [16, 7] described in Section 2. Using the simplest example of Painlev´e-2 systems, we show in Subsection 2.1 how the ingredients of a non-abelian hierarchy can be constructed. It turns out that non-abelianization of only two simplest first integrals and one infinitesimal symmetry allows one to obtain a finite list of non-abelian P2 systems. These systems coincide with ones from the paper [3], where a different criterion of integrability for matrix Painlev´e-2 equations has been used. In Section 3, using the same approach, we find a complete list of Painlev´e-6 type autonomous systems. Due to the complexity of the calculations, we first classify homogeneous systems, which are the leading parts of autonomous systems of the P6 type. For each leading part, finding the remaining coefficients is not too difficult. The resulting list contains different systems, including 19 systems from [5, 6]. One of the reasons for the appearance of a large number of non-abelian systems of the same type is the presence of transformations that preserve integrability of systems (2) or (1). The simplest example of such a transformation is the matrix transposition τ(u) = u T , τ(v) = v T . In Appendix A.1, we present an explicit form of only 8 new systems non-equivalent with respect to τ. For the old 19 systems we use the notation and lists from our previous papers [5, 6]. To reconstruct the Painlev´e system of the form (1) corresponding to an autonomous P6 system (2) described in Section 3, we have to replace the time t with z and choose f(z) = z(z − 1) in (1). 2A group of point transformations (see Subsection 5.1.1) isomorphic to S3 × Z2 acts on the set of all non-autonomous systems of the Painlev´e-6 type. The Hamiltonian systems [5] form one orbit of this action, while the systems with the generalized Okamoto integral [6] and systems listed in Appendix A.1 have three and four orbits, respectively. Thus, there are 8 non-equivalent systems of the Painlev´e-6 type. Following Assumption 1, in Section 4, we find all autonomous non-abelian Painlev´e systems of P1 − P5 types. All known and several new systems are contained in our list. New systems are presented in Appendices A.5 – A.2. Non-autonomous Painlev´e P1 − P5 systems are restored using autonomous systems found in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to the study of non-autonomous Painlev´e systems whose auxiliary autonomous systems were constructed in Sections 3 and 4. In subsection 5.1, we describe admissible transformations in each of the cases P1 − P6. For non-abelian systems of P6 type we present in subsection 5.2.1 an universal formula for isomonodromic Lax pairs of the form Az − Bλ = [B, A], (4) where A(z, u, v, λ) and B(z, u, v, λ) are some 2×2 matrices, rational in the spectral parameter λ and in z, linear in the parameters κi, and polynomial in u, v. It is suitable for a wide family of systems whose autonomous systems satisfy the condition 3 of Assumption 1. Besides κi , the family contains 9 parameters. To specify these parameters we apply the non-abelianization procedure for symmetries of the autonomous system. Similar universal formulas for the Lax representation were also found in Subsections 5.2.2 – 5.2.6 for P5 − P1 type systems. It turns out that non-abelian systems of the Painlev´e-6 type generate non-abelian Painlev´e systems of the P1 − P5 type by the standard limiting procedure described in [6]. In Subsection 5.3 we present limiting transition schemes for new P6 systems obtained in this paper. 2 Non-abelianization of hierarchy In the scalar Painlev´e case, any auxiliary system (2) has a polynomial Hamiltonian H and a Lax representation (3). The hierarchy of commuting symmetries consists of the systems ( utk = (P1 + z Q1) Hk, vtk = (P2 + z Q2) Hk, (5) which have the Lax representations Ltk = [HkM, L]. (6) These symmetries are trivial: if we fix a value of the integral H then the symmetries coincide (up to a scaling of t) with the system (2). We assume that all the above components of the hierarchy admit the non-abelianization. This means that • we consider systems of the form (2) with matrix polynomials Pi and Qi such that if the size m of matrices u and v is equal to one, the systems coincide with the corresponding auxiliary autonomous system for a given scalar system of Painlev´e type; • there exist matrix polynomials Si such that if m = 1 they coincide with Hi and traces of Si are first integrals of the matrix system2; 2We do not assume that trace S1 is its Hamiltonian. 3• the matrix system has a Lax representation (3) that coincides with the representation for scalar system if m = 1; • for any k the matrix system has a (matrix) symmetry that coincides with (5) if m = 1. These symmetries commute with each other; • any matrix symmetry possesses a Lax representation coinciding with the scalar representation (6) if m = 1. 2.1 Painlev´e-2 systems Let us illustrate our approach by the simplest example of the Painlev´e-2 systems. Starting with trivial hierarchy of the scalar system, we show that the non-abelianization of several its ingredients leads to a finite list of matrix Painlev´e-2 systems. It was proved in [3] that all these systems satisfy the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test. In the commutative case, the system has the form    du dz = −u 2 + v − z, dv dz = 2uv + κ, (7) where κ is an arbitrary parameter. This system is Hamiltonian with the Hamiltonian H = −u v + v 2 − κu − zv, which is a first integral for the auxiliary autonomous system    du dt = −u 2 + v − z, dv dt = 2uv + κ. (8) It is clear that the systems    du dtk = (−u 2 + v − z) Hk, dv dtk = (2uv + κ) Hk (9) are commuting infinitesimal symmetries for (8). It is easy to verify that Lax representation (3) with L(λ) = −4 0 λ 2 + 0 4u 4u λ + 2u 2 + z −2u2 + 2v − z 2u 2 − 2v + z −2u2 − z + 0 κ κ λ − , M(λ) = 1 0 − λ + −βu −u −u −βu (10) is a Lax representation for system (8) 3 and therefore the operators L and Mk = Hk M define a Lax pair for system (9). The hierarchy described above looks completely trivial: all integrals are powers of only one integral H, the symmetries and corresponding M-operators are proportional if we fix a value of H. However, all these objects become non-trivial after the non-abelianization [16, 7]. In the scalar case the parameter β in the M-operator is inessential. 4For the non-abelianization of system (8), we replace each monomial in the right-hand side by a sum of non-commutative monomials such that under the commutative reduction the system coincides with (8). The result can be written in the form    du dt = −u 2 + v − z, dv dt = uv + vu + β[v, u] + κ, (11) where κ, β ∈ C. 2.1.1 Non-abelianization of integrals Let us generalize to the non-abelian case several first integrals. Proposition 1. For any β the autonomous system (11) possesses first integrals of the form traceS1 and trace S2 such that under the commutative reduction the non-commutative polynomials S1 and S2 coincide with H and H , respectively. Proof. The general ansatz for the polynomial S1 can be written as S1 = −u v + v 2 − κu − zv. One can verify that the condition d dt trace (Si) = 0 (12) with i = 1 holds. Using the explicit formula H2 = u v 2 − u v 3 + v 4 + 2κu v − κuv2 + κ 2u2 + z u v 2 − v 3 + κuv + z v , we construct a general ansatz for the non-abelian polynomial S2. Since the monomials {vu3vu, vu2vu2, vu4v}, {vuvuv, vu2v }, {vuvu, vu2v}, {vuv} define complete lists of homogeneous polynomials of degrees (4, 2), (2, 3), (2, 2) and (1, 2) in u and v up to commutators, we take S2 = a1vu3vu + a2vu2vu2 + (1 − a1 − a2)vu4v + a3vuvuv + (−1 − a3)vu2v 2 + v + 2κvu3 − κvuv + κu2 + z a4vuvu + (1 − a4)vu2v − v 3 + κvu + z v . Condition (12) with i = 2 leads to a system of linear algebraic equations for aj , j = 1, . . . , 4, whose coefficients depend on β. Solving this system, we find that for any β a1 = 0, a2 = 1, a3 = and a4 remains to be arbitrary. Therefore, the autonomous system has the first integral traceS2, where S2 = vu2vu2 − vu2v 2 + v 4 + 2κvu3 − κvuv + κu2 + z vu2v − v 3 + κvu + a4z(vu2v − vuvu) + z v . In the case of the non-commutative Painlev´e-2 system, the general ansatz for the righthand side depends only on one parameter β and our first test, based on the non-abelianization of the first integrals, does not determine β. For comparison, in the case of the Painlev´e-6, it reduces the number of unknown coefficients from 18 to 9. 4Note that such polynomials are defined up to commutators. 52.1.2 Non-abelianization of symmetries In contrast to the above computation, the non-abelianization of the simplest symmetry (9) with k = 1 gives rise to a condition for β. The general ansatz for the non-abelian symmetry has the form ut1 = a1u v + a2u vu + a3u vu2 + a4uvu3 + 1 − Xai vu4 + c1u v 2 + c2uvuv + c3uv2u + c4vu2v + c5vuvu + − 2 − Xci v 2u2 + κu3 + v 3 + e1uv + (−κ − e1)vu + z g1u v + g2uvu + (1 − g1 − g2)vu2 − v 2 + κu+ z v, vt1 = b1 u v 2 + b2 u vuv + b3 u v 2u + b4 uvu v + b5 uvuvu + b6 uv2u 2 + b7 vu v + b8 vu2vu + b9vuvu2 + −2 − Xbi v 2u3 + d1uv3 + d2vuv2 + d3v2uv + 1 − Xdi v 3u + f1u v + f2uvu + (−3κ − f1 − f2)vu2 + κv2 − κ 2u + z h1uv2 + h2vuv + (−1 − h1 − h2)v 2u − κv, where ai, bi, ci, di, e1, fi, gi, hi ∈ C. According to the item 3 of Assumption 1, the symmetry should have the first integrals trace S1 and trace S2 found in Proposition 1. That leads to the following linear relations between coefficients of the symmetry b1 = −a1, b2 = −a1 − a2, b3 = 0, b4 = −a1 − a2 − a3, b5 = 0, b6 = 0, b7 = 1 − a2 − a3 − a4, b8 = −1 + a1 + a2, b9 = −1 + a1 + a2 + a3, c4 = − , c5 = −c2, d1 = −c1, d2 = 2 + c1 − c2, d3 = −12 − c1 + c2 − c3, f2 = −κ, h1 = −g1, h2 = −g2. The remaining coefficients of the symmetry can be easily expressed via β from the compatibility conditions ut τ − uτ t = 0 and vt τ − vτ t = 0 as follows a1 = 24 (β − 2) (β 2 − 1)β, a2 = − (β 2 − 4) (β − 1) β, a3 = (β 2 − 4) (β2 − 1), a4 = − (β 2 − 4) β (β + 1), c1 = − 12 (β − 2) (β − 1) (β + 3), c2 = (β 2 − 4) β, c3 = 0, e1 = − κ, f1 = κ (β − 1), g2 = (2 − β − 4g1). Substituting these formulas into the compatibility conditions, we arrive at β (β 2 − 1) (β2 − 4) = 0, β (β − 2) (β − 1) − 12 g = 0. Thus, we proved Proposition 2. The symmetry (9) with k = 1 admits a non-abelianization iff β = 0, ±1, ±2. (13) Remark 1. The class of systems of the form (11) is invariant under the matrix transposition τ(u) = u T , τ(v) = v T . Under this transposition the parameter β changes as follows τ(β) = −β. Therefore, there exist three non-equivalent systems with β = −2, −1, 0. The Hamiltonian non-commutative system (see [12, 5]) corresponds to β = 0. 6The same set (13) of admissible values of the parameter β was obtained in [3], where matrix Painlev´e-2 systems satisfying the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test were investigated. Notice that in the approach related to the test it is crucial that u and v are matrices (of an arbitrary size), while the above considerations can be generalized to the non-abelian case without any changes. 2.1.3 Non-abelianization of Lax representations The non-abelianization of the Lax representation (10) gives rise to the Lax pair L(λ) = −4 0 λ 2 + 0 4u 4u λ + 2u 2 + z −2u2 + 2v − z 2u 2 − 2v + z −2u2 − z + 0 κ κ λ − , M(λ) = 1 0 − λ + −β u −u −u −β u . for auxiliary autonomous system (11). It turns out that the non-abelian symmetry described above has the Lax representation with the same L-operator and M1(λ) = [u, v] 0 [u, v] λ 2 + Ω1 [u, [u, v]] − [u, [u, v]] −Ω λ + Ω2 + 2Ω3 Ω Ω2 Ω2 + 2Ω , where Ω1 = −u v − vu2 + v 2 − 2κu − zv, Ω2 = u vu + uvu2 − uv2 + vuv − v 2u + 2κu2 + z(uv + vu), Ω3 = −a1u v − (a1 + a2)u vu − (a1 + a2 + a3)uvu2 + 1 − Xai vu3 − c1uv2 + f1u + − 2 − c vuv + (−c1 − c3)v 2u + −e1 − κ v + z −g1uv + 2 − g1 − g vu. The coefficients of Ω3 are expressed through β in Subsection 2.1.2. In the commutative case, the operator M1 coincides with HM. The relation [∂t − M, ∂t1 − M1] = 0 is equivalent to condition (13). 3 The autonomous systems of Painlev´e-6 type In the Painlev´e-6 case, we follow the line of the previous section. However, the computations become extremely laborious. In particular, the ansatz for non-abelian symmetry contains about 1000 undetermined coefficients. The following trick turns out to be very helpful: we succeeded to find the leading coefficients of the non-abelian system investigating separately the homogeneous system generated by the leading parts. In the scalar case, the auxiliary autonomous system has the form    du dt = 2u 3v − 2u2v − κ1u2 + κ2u + z −2u 2v + 2uv + κ4u + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4) , dv dt = −3u 2v2 + 2uv2 + 2κ1uv − κ2v + κ3 + z 2uv2 − v 2 − κ4v , (14) where z ∈ C and κi are arbitrary parameters. The Hamiltonian H for (14) is given by H = H1 + z H2, 7with H1 = u v 2 − u v 2 − κ1u v + κ2uv − κ3u, H2 = −u v 2 + uv2 + κ4uv + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)v. The non-abelianization of (14) is a system of the form (2), where Pi and Qi are noncommutative polynomials given by P1(u, v) = a1u v + a2u vu + a3uvu2 + (2 − a1 − a2 − a3)vu3 + c1u v + (−2 − c1 − c2)uvu + c2vu2 − κ1u 2 + κ2u, Q1(u, v) = f1u v + (−2 − f1 − f2)uvu + f2vu2 + h1uv + (2 − h1)vu + κ4u + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4), P2(u, v) = b1u v 2 + b2uvuv + b3uv2u + b4vu v + b5vuvu + −3 − Xbi v 2u + d1uv2 + (2 − d1 − d2)vuv + d2v 2u + e1uv + (2κ1 − e1)vu − κ2v + κ3, Q2(u, v) = g1uv2 + (2 − g1 − g2)vuv + g2v 2u − v2 − κ4v (15) where ai, bi, ci, di, fi, gi, h1, and e1 belong to C. It is clear that if system (2), (15) possesses integrals, symmetries and Lax representation, then their leading parts define the corresponding objects for its leading homogeneous part. For this reason, we first perform a non-abelianization of the homogeneous part of the scalar autonomous system of Painlev´e-6 type. 3.1 Homogeneous non-abelian systems of Painlev´e-6 type The homogeneous principal part5, ( u ′ = 2u3v, v ′ = −3u2v , (16) of (14) possesses the first integral I = u v . For any N the following system ( uτ = u ′ I N , vτ = v ′ I N (17) is an infinitesimal symmetry of (16). In addition to (17), the system (16) has symmetries ( uτ = u IN , vτ = −2v IN , (18) which are related to the homogeneity of the system. The degrees of the simplest symmetries are equal to 6 and 9. We are going to find all non-abelianizations of system (16) that have non-abelian symmetries of degree 6 and 9. The non-abelianization of (16) is given by    u ′ = a1 u3v + a2 u2vu + a3 uvu2 + (2 − a1 − a2 − a3) vu , v ′ = b1 u2v2 + b2 uvuv + b3 uv2u + b4 vu2v + b5 vuvu + (−3 − b1 − b2 − b3 − b4 − b5) v 2u . (19) 5Here and below we denote t-derivatives by ′ . 8As in the Painlev´e-2 case (see Subsection 2.1.1), we are going to generalize to the non-abelian case several first integrals. It allows us to reduce the number of unknown coefficients in (19). Lemma 1. If the integrals I and I 2 admit a non-abelianization then the system (19) has the form    u ′ = a1 u3v + a2 u2vu + a3 uvu2 + (2 − a1 − a2 − a3) vu , v ′ = −a1 u2v2 + (−a1 − a2) uvuv + (1 − a2 − a3) vu2v + (−2 + a1 + a2) vuvu + (−2 + a1 + a2 + a3) v 2u . (20) Following the line of Subsection 2.1.2, we specify the remaining parameters in (20) by the non-abelianization of symmetries. Proposition 3. If system (20) admits a non-abelianization of symmetries of degrees 6 and 9 then it has one of the following forms (up to the transposition u → u T , v → v T ) Case 1: a1 = a, a2 = 2 − a, a3 = 0, ( u ′ = a u3v + (2 − a) u2vu, v ′ = −a u2v2 − 2uvuv + (−1 + a) vu2v; Case 2: a1 = 0, a2 = a, a3 = 2 − a, ( u ′ = a u2vu + (2 − a) uvu , v ′ = −a uvuv − vu2v + (−2 + a)vuvu, with a = −1, 0, 1, 2 and a = −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. Proof. In the proof, we first find relations between the coefficients of system (20) which is equivalent to the existence of a non-abelianization of the symmetry of degree 6. The non-abelianization ansatz for symmetry (18) with N = 1 is obvious, and we do not present it here. Let us denote the unknown coefficients of the monomials u 2vuvu, uvu2vu, uvuvu2in the ansatz by c1, c2, c3, respectively. The compatibility symmetry condition produces a large system of non-linear algebraic equations. Eliminating variables, we arrive at an autonomous subsystem for the coefficients a1, a2, a3, c1, c2, c3. One of its equations is a1 a3 = 0 which leads to two different cases. If a1 = 0, then the subsystem is equivalent to (a2 + a3 − 2) c2 = 0, (a2 − 2) a2 − (a3 − 2) a3c2 = 0, a3 ((a3 − 2) c2 + a2) = 0, (a3 − 2) a3 (c2 − 1) c2 = 0, (a3 − 1) c3 = 0, c3 (a2 − c2) = 0, (c2 − 1) c2c3 = 0. This system has the following solution a3 = 2 − a, a2 = a, c2 = 1, c3 = 0, where a is an arbitrary parameter. In the case a3 = 0, we obtain the following system (a1 − a2) (a1 + a2 − 2) = 0, a2 (a1 + a2 − 2) = 0, (a1 − 1) c1 = 0, (a2 − 1) c1 = 0, a1c2 = 0, c1c2 = 0, (a2 − 2) c2 = 0, c3 = 0. 9The first two equations give a2 = 2 − a, a1 = a. To specify an arbitrary parameter a, we use a non-abelian symmetry of degree 9. Let us consider the compatibility condition and denote the unknown coefficients related to the symmetry that cannot be determined uniquely from this condition by d1 and d2. Then, in Case 1, these monomials are d1 u 3vu2vuv, d2 u3vuvu2v and one can obtain a system that is equivalent to d1 − (a − 1)d2 = 0, (d2 − 1) d2 = 0, d1 (d2 − 1) = 0, a 2 + a − 4d1 − 2d2 = 0, (d1 − 1) d1 = 0, (a − 2)d1 = 0. So, the solution is one of the following: a = −1, d1 = 0, d2 = 0; a = 0, d1 = 0, d2 = 0; a = 1, d1 = 0, d2 = 1; a = 2, d1 = 1, d2 = 1. Similarly, in Case 2, a reduced system can be written as (d2 − 1) d2 = 0, d1 (d1 + 1) = 0, d2 (a − d1) = 0, d1 (a + 4d2 − 3) = 0, (a − 3)a + 2 (d1 + (d1 − 1) d2 + 1) = 0, where d1 and d2 are coefficients of uvu2vu2vu and uvuvu2vu2, respectively. The system possesses one of the following solutions: a = −1, d1 = −1, d2 = 1; a = 0, d1 = 0, d2 = 1; a = 1, d1 = 0, d2 = 0; a = 2, d1 = 0, d2 = 0; a = 3, d1 = −1, d2 = 0. Therefore, we arrive at the statement of the proposition. Remark 2. Note that Case 1, a = 0 coincides with Case 2, a = 2. Remark 3. The matrix transposition τ : u → u T , v → v T preserves the class of systems (2), (15) and maps integrable systems to integrable. In particular, systems related to Case 2 from Proposition 3 with a = 0 and a = 2 as well as with a = −1 and a = 3 are dual with respect to the transposition. Sometimes we formulate classification statements up to the transposition. 3.2 General case Considering system (2), (15), we obtain the following generalization of Lemma 1: Proposition 4. An autonomous system of the form (2), (15) admits a non-abelianization of the integrals H6 and H iff the polynomials Pi and Qi have the form P1(u, v) = a1 u v + a2 u vu + a3 uvu2 + (2 − a1 − a2 − a3) vu + c1 u v + (−2 − c1 − c2) uvu + c2 vu2 − κ1 u 2 + κ2 u, Q1(u, v) = f1 u v + (−2 − f1 − f2) uvu + f2 vu + h1 uv + (2 − h1) vu + κ4u + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4), (21) 10P2(u, v) = −a1 u v 2 + (−a1 − a2) uvuv + (1 − a2 − a3) vu v + (−2 + a1 + a2) vuvu + (−2 + a1 + a2 + a3) v 2u − c1 uv2 + (2 + c1 + c2) vuv − c2 v 2u + e1 uv + (2κ1 − e1) vu − κ2 v + κ3, Q2(u, v) = −f1 uv2 + (2 + f1 + f2) vuv − f2 v 2u − v2 − κ4 v. (22) As it was mentioned at the beginning of Section 3, if system (15) satisfy Assumption 1, then its leading homogeneous part also satisfies it. Thus, Proposition 3 separates the classification of systems (2), (21), (22) into 9 different cases. We consider each of these cases independently6. An inhomogeneous scalar Painlev´e-6 system does not have symmetry of order 6. Therefore, we consider non-abelianization of the symmetry of order 9. Just as in Subsection 2.1.2, we refine the form of the symmetry, after which about indeterminate coefficients remain in the ansatz for the symmetry. The compatibility condition of the system and symmetry leads to a huge overdetermined system of non-linear algebraic equations with respect to the remaining nine coefficients in the equation and the symmetry coefficients. Despite its size, the system is easily solved using the computer algebra system \"Mathematica\". Theorem 2. A system (2) with (21), (22), whose leading part is decribed by Proposition 3, admits a non-abelianization of the symmetry of degree 9 iff it belong to one of the following lists i) Appendix A.1 from the paper [5], ii) Appendix A.1 from the paper [6], iii) Appendix A.1 in this paper (up to the transposition τ). 4 Autonomous systems of P5 − P1 types 4.1 Systems of P5 type The scalar auxiliary autonomous system of the Painlev´e-5 type is defined by the Hamiltonian H of the form H = u v 2 − 2u v 2 + v2 − κ1u v + (κ1 + κ2)uv − κ2v − κ3u + κ4zuv. (23) A non-abelian generalization of this system can be written as    du dt = a1u 3v + a2u2vu + a3uvu2 + (2 − Pai) vu3 + c1u 2v + (−4 − c1 − c2)uvu + c2vu2 − κ1u 2 + e1uv + (2 − e1)vu + (κ1 + κ2)u − κ2 + κ4zu, dv dt = b1u 2v2 + b2uvuv + b3uv2u + b4vu2v + b5vuvu + (−3 − Pbi) v 2u + d1uv2 + (4 − d1 − d2)vuv − d2v 2u − v2 + f1uv + (2κ1 − f1)vu − (κ1 + κ2)v + κ3 − κ4zv, (24) where ai, bi, ci, di, e1, f1, κi ∈ C. In fact, it suffices to consider 5 cases that are not equivalent with respect to the transposition τ. 11Proposition 5. a) A system of the form (2) admits a non-abelianization of integrals H and H iff b1 = −a1, b2 = −a1 − a2, b3 = 0, b4 = 1 − a2 − a3, b5 = −2 + a1 + a2, d1 = −c1, d2 = −c2. b) If the system additionally admits a non-abelianiazation of the symmetry (5) of degree 9, then it belongs to one of the following lists i) Appendix A.2 from [5], ii) Appendix A.2 from [6], iii) Appendix A.2 in this paper (up to the transposition τ). 4.2 Systems of P4 type The scalar Hamiltonian for an autonomous P4 system is given by H = uv2 − u v + κ2v − κ3u − 2zuv. (25) Then, the general non-abelian autonomous system can be written in the form    du dt = −u 2 + 2uv + α [u, v] − 2zu + κ2, dv dt = −v 2 + 2vu + β [v, u] + 2zv + κ (26) with the parameters α, β ∈ C to be defined. Proposition 6. a) For any parameters α, β the system (2) admits a non-abelianization of the first integrals H and H2. b) The autonomous system possesses a non-abelian symmetry of degree 5 iff it belongs to one of the following lists i) Appendix A.3 from [5], ii) Appendix A.3 from [6], iii) Appendix A.3 (up to the transposition τ). 4.3 P3 type systems In the P3 case, we deal with the Painlev´e- ′ version of the scalar system. The Hamiltonian of the corresponding autonomous system is given by: H = u v 2 + κ2u v + κ1uv + κ3u + κ4zv. (27) A non-abelian generalization of the system can be written as    du dt = a1u 2v + (2 − a1 − a2)uvu + a2vu2 + κ1u + κ2u2 + κ4z, dv dt = b1uv2 − (2 + b1 + b2)vuv + b2v 2u − κ1v + c1uv + (−2κ2 − c1)vu − κ3, (28) where ai, bi, c1, κi ∈ C. 12Proposition 7. a) A system of the form (28) admits a non-abelianization of integrals H and H iff b1 = −a1, b2 = −a2. b) If the system additionally admits a non-abelianiazation of the symmetry (5) of degree 7, then it belongs to one of the following lists i) Appendix A.4 from [5], ii) Appendix A.4 from [6], iii) Appendix A.4 (up to the transposition τ). 4.4 Systems of P2 type These systems were considered in Subsection 2.1 in details. There are three systems nonequivalent with respect to the transposition, which correspond to results of the paper [3] (see also [15]). 4.5 P1 type system In the scalar case, an autonomous system has the form    du dt = v, dv dt = 6u 2 + z. For a non-abelianization of this system we can just replace the variables u and v with noncommutative ones. It turns out that this analog admits Assumption 1. Probably, the corresponding matrix equation Painlev´e-1 first time appeared in the paper [4]. 5 Non-abelian Painlev´e systems Formally, the restoring of a Painlev´e system of the form (1) corresponding to any autonomous system (2) described in Sections 3 and 4 is very simple. We have to replace the time t with z and choose f(z) = z(z − 1) in the P6 case, f(z) = z for P5 and P3 systems, and f(z) = otherwise. The question arises whether these systems are integrable. It is not known whether all of them satisfy the Painlev´e property. However, • all known matrix Painlev´e systems can be obtained in this way; • all these systems possess an isomonodromic Lax representation; • systems of different types are related by limiting transitions in the same way as in the scalar case and can be obtained by degenerations of the P6 systems. 135.1 Transformation groups and their orbits 5.1.1 P6 case The scalar Painlev´e-6 system admits the linear B¨acklund transformations r1 : (z, u, v) 7→ (1 − z, 1 − u, −v), r2 : (z, u, v) 7→ z − , z−1u, zv, which change the parameters as r1 : (κ1, κ2, κ3, κ4) 7→ (κ1, 2κ1 − κ2 − κ4, κ3, κ4), r2 : (κ1, κ2, κ3, κ4) 7→ (κ1, κ4 − 1, κ3, κ2 + 1). These involutions generate a group isomorphic to S3. In the non-abelian case the transposition τ together with the above transformations act on the set of integrable non-abelian Painlev´e-6 systems. The transposition τ changes the parameters in (21), (22) as follows: τ (a1, a2, a3, c1, c2, e1, f1, f2, h1) = (2 − a1 − a2 − a3, a3, a2, c2, c1, 2κ1 − e1, f2, f1, 2 − h1). Systems 1P6 – 8P6 of the P6 type (see Appendix A.1) are non-equivalent with respect to τ. The S3-action on these systems is given by: r1(1P6) = 1P6, r2(1P6) = 1P6, r1(2P6) = 4P6, r2(2P6) = 2P6, r1(3P6) = 3P6, r2(3P6) = 4P6, r1(4P6) = 2P6, r2(4P6) = 3P6, r1(5P6) = 5P6, r2(5P6) = 5P6, r1(6P6) = 8P6, r2(6P6) = 7P6, r1(7P6) = 7P6, r2(7P6) = 6P6, r1(8P6) = 6P6, r2(8P6) = 8P6. Transformations r1, r2 taking together with the transposition τ generate a group isomorphic to S3 × Z2. The action of this group has the following four orbits: Orbit 1 = {1P6, τ(1P6)} , Orbit 2 = {2P6, τ(2P6), 3P6, τ(3P6), 4P6, τ(4P6)} , Orbit 3 = {5P6, τ(5P6)} , Orbit 4 = {6P6, τ(6P6), 7P6, τ(7P6), 8P6, τ(8P6)} . Besides four non-equivalent new systems corresponding to the orbits, we have five nonequivalent systems with the generalized Okamoto integral found in [6] and one Hamiltonian non-abelian system [12, 5]. 5.1.2 P5 case The transposition τ acts on the parameters of system (24) as τ (a1, a2, a3, c1, c2, e1, f1) = (2 − a1 − a2 − a3, a3, a2, c2, c1, 2 − e1, 2κ1 − f1). Its action on the systems from Appendix A.2 forms four orbits: Orbit 1 = {1P5, τ(1P5)} , Orbit 2 = {2P5, τ(2P5)} , Orbit 3 = {3P5, τ(3P5)} , Orbit 4 = {4P5, τ(4P5)} . Thus we have 5 non-equivalent systems obtained in [6], one Hamiltonian system [12, 5] and 4 new systems found in this paper. 145.1.3 P4 case The transposition τ and the involutions s1 (u, v, z) = (iv, iu, −iz), s2 (u, v, z) = (−iu, i(v − u − 2z), −iz) preserve a class of systems of the form (26), changing the parameters as τ (α, β) = (−2 − α, −2 − β), s1 (α, β) = (β, α), s2 (α, β) = (α, −α − β − 3). There are three systems non-equivalent with respect to the group generated by τ, s1, and s2. One of them, Hamiltonian, was found in [12], the second has the Okamoto integral [6], and the third one is presented in Appendix A.3. All of them also arose in the paper [7], where the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test was used for classification (see also [1]). 5.1.4 P3 case The transposition τ acts on the parameters of system (28) in the following way τ (a1, a2, c1) = (a2, a1, −c1 − 2κ2). Appendix A.4 contains two systems non-equivalent with respect to τ. Four systems with the Okamoto integral can be found in [5]. For one more, Hamiltonian system, see [12, 5]. 5.1.5 P2 case There are three systems non-equivalent with respect to the transposition, which correspond to results of the paper [3] (see also [15]). 5.1.6 P1 case. There is only one matrix P1 system (see section 4.5). Being Hamiltonian, it is invariant with respect to the transposition τ. 5.2 Isomonodromic representations All scalar Painlev´e systems admit an isomonodromic representation [9, 10] of the form (4). Note that for commuting variables u and v the relation (4) admits shifts of the form B 7→ B + q(z, u, v) I, (29) where q is an arbitrary polynomial in u and v, while in the non-commutative case such transformations are not allowed. Using the non-abelianization procedure proposed in [7], we generalize well-known isomonodromic pairs for the scalar P6 − P1 systems to the non-abelian case. As a result, we obtain Lax pairs not only for specific Painlev´e-type systems with auxiliary autonomous systems listed in Sections 3 and 4, but for whole classes of systems satisfying the property 3 in Assumption 1 (see Proposition 4 and item a) in Propositions 5 – 7). The non-abelianization procedure is based on the observation that most of Lax pairs for scalar Painlev´e type systems are homogeneous in the following sense. If we represent A and B as rational functions in λ, z, and κi with coefficients being 2 × 2 matrices polynomial in u and v, then these coefficients turn out to be homogeneous for proper weights of u and v (see the next section for details). 155.2.1 Systems of P6 type The Lax representation (4) for the commutative P6 system (14) found in [10] is defined by A(z, λ) = A0(z) λ + A1(z) λ − + A2(z) λ − z , B(z, λ) = B0(z) − A2(z) λ − z , (30) where the matrices A0(z), A1(z), A2(z), and B0(z) are equivalent to A0 = −1 − κ1 + κ4 uz−1 − 0 , A1 = −uv + κ1 −u 2v2 + κ1uv + κ3 uv , A2 = uv + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4) −uz− zuv2 + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)zv −uv , B0 = (z(z − 1))− 2u 2v − κ1u − z (2uv + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)) −uv2 − (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)v ! . If we assign the weights w(u) = w(v) = 1 to the variables, then any matrix coefficient Q(u, v) has homogeneous entries qij such that w(q11) = w(q22) = w(q12) + 2 = w(q21) − 2. Under the non-abelianization we preserve the same structure of A and B in λ, z, and κi and the homogeneity property. Besides, we require the in the scalar limit the pair coincides with the described above up to a transformation of the form (29). Proposition 8. Any non-abelian system of the P6 type described in Proposition 4, is equivalent to the zero-curvature condition (4) with matrices A(z, λ) and B(z, λ) of the form (30), where A0 = −1 − κ1 + κ4 uz−1 − 0 , A1 = −vu + κ1 −vuvu + κ1vu + κ3 vu , A2 = vu + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4) −uz− z v2u + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)zv −vu , B0 = (z(z − 1))− uvu + vu2 − κ1u − z (2vu + (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)) −v 2u − (κ1 − κ2 − κ4)v ! + q(z, u, v) I, z(z − 1) q(z, u, v) = −a1u v − (a1 + a2)uvu + (1 − a1 − a2 − a3)vu2 − c1uv + (1 + c2)vu + e1u + z (−f1uv + (2 + f2)vu − h1v). In the scalar case the polynomial q can be removed by shift (29). 5.2.2 Systems of P5 type The Painlev´e-5 system associated with the Hamiltonian (23) admits an isomonodromic Lax pair of the form A(λ, z) = A0(z) + A1(z) λ + A2(z) λ − , B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z), (31) where [10] A0 = κ4z 0 , A1 = −uv + κ1 −u 2v2 + κ1uv + κ3 uv , A2 = uv − κ2 −u uv2 − κ2v −uv , 16B1 = κ4 0 , B0 = z − 2u 2v − 2uv − κ1u + κ1 −u + −u 2v2 + uv2 + κ1uv − κ2v + κ3 . This Lax pair can be generalized to the non-abelian case as follows Proposition 9. Let a non-abelian system of the P5 type possesses an auxiliary autonomous system described in the item a) of Proposition 5. Then it has an isomonodromic Lax pair of the form (31) with matrices A0 = κ4z 0 , A1 = −vu + κ1 −vuvu + κ1vu + κ3 vu , A2 = vu − κ2 −u v 2u − κ2v −vu , B1 = κ4 0 , B0 = z − uvu + vu2 − 2vu − κ1u + κ1 −u + −vuvu + v 2u + κ1vu − κ2v + κ3 + q(z, u, v) I, z q(z, u, v) = −a1u v − (a1 + a2)uvu + (1 − a1 − a2 − a3)vu2 − c1uv + (3 + c2)vu + f1u − e1v. 5.2.3 Systems of P4 type The Hamiltonian (25) leads to the Painlev´e-4 system. Its well-known [10] that this system is equivalent to the zero-curvature condition (4) with A(λ, z) = A1λ + A0(z) + A−1(z)λ − , B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z), (32) where the matrices A1, A0(z), A−1(z), B1, and B0(z) are given by A1 = −2 0 , A0 = −2z uv + κ3 , A−1 = uv + κ2 −u uv2 + κ2v −uv , B1 = −2 0 , B0 = −u − 2z uv + κ3 . According to the item a) from Proposition 6, non-abelian systems of the P4 type associated with (26) admit the non-abelianization of the first integrals. One can verify that they also have an isomonodromic representation. Proposition 10. For any α, β ∈ C, a non-abelian P4 type system defined by the autonomous system (26) has a Lax pair of the form (32), where A1 = −2 0 , A0 = −2z vu + κ3 , A−1 = vu + κ2 −u v 2u + κ2v −vu , B1 = −2 0 , B0 = −u − 2z vu + κ3 + q(z, u, v) I, q(z, u, v) = −βu − (α + 2)v. 175.2.4 P3 type systems The scalar P ′ system related to Hamiltonian (27) has (see [10]) the following isomonodromic Lax pair A(λ, z) = A0(z) + A−1(z)λ −1 + A−2(z)λ− , B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z), (33) where the matrices A0(z), A−1(z), A−2(z), B1, and B0(z) are equivalent to A0 = κ4z 0 , A−1 = − κ1 u uv2 + κ1v + κ2uv + κ3 , A−2 = v + κ2 − v 2 + κ2v −v , B1 = κ4 0 , B0 = z − 2uv + κ2u −u − uv2 + κ1v + κ2uv + κ ! . Proposition 11. Suppose that a non-abelian system of the P ′ type has an auxiliary autonomous system given by the item a) of Proposition 7. Then it is equivalent to (4), where a Lax pair has the form (33) with A0 = κ4z 0 , A−1 = − κ1 u vuv + κ1v + κ2vu + κ3 , A−2 = v + κ2 − v 2 + κ2v −v , B1 = κ4 0 , B0 = z − uv + vu + κ2u −u − (vuv + κ1v + κ2vu + κ3) + q(z, u, v) I, z q(z, u, v) = −a1uv + (a2 − 1)vu + c1u. Special cases of P ′ type systems are considered in Appendix B. 5.2.5 Systems of P2 type The commutative Painlev´e-2 system (7) possesses an isomonodromic Lax pair of the form [10] A(λ, z) = A2λ 2 + A1(z)λ + A0(z), B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z), (34) where the matrices A2, A1(z), A0(z), B1, and B0(z) are equivalent to the following: A2 = 2 0 , A1 = 0 − −v , A0 = −v + z −2u uv + κ v , B1 = 1 0 , B0 = −u − − v . Proposition 12. Any non-abelian system of the P2 corresponding to autonomous system (11), is equivalent to the zero-curvature condition (4) with matrices A(z, λ) and B(z, λ) of the form (34), where A2 = 2 0 , A1 = 0 − −v , A0 = −v + z −2u vu + κ v , B1 = 1 0 , B0 = −u − − v + q(z, u, v) I, q(z, u, v) = (1 − β)u. 18Remark 4. Here and in Subsection 2.1, we considered the Lax pairs of Jimbo-Miwa [10] and the Flaschka-Newell types for the Painlev´e-2 equation. It was shown in [17, 11] that in the scalar case these Lax pairs are related to each other by a generalized Laplace transform supplemented with a gauge transformation. Formally, assuming the cancellation of terms that arise from the integration by parts, it is easy to verify that this correspondence can be generalized to the non-abelian case. 5.2.6 P1 type system The P1 system has the Lax pair given by A(λ, z) = A2λ 2 + A1(z)λ + A0(z), B(λ, z) = B1λ + B0(z) with A2 = 0 2 , A1 = 0 − −2u , A0 = −v −2u 2u 2 + z v , B1 = 0 1 , B0 = 0 − −2u . It can be generalized to the non-abelian case by replacing the variables u and v with noncommutative ones. 5.3 Tree of degenerations In [6] limiting transitions for non-abelian Painlev´e-type systems having Okamoto integrals were found. The same formulas with minor changes in constants can be applied for systems from the current paper . The degeneration trees for P6 systems 1P6 – 8P6 from Appendix A.1 non-equivalent with respect to the transposition τ are shown schematically in Figures 1, 2, and 3. 4P 1P ′ 3P 2P ′ 1P6 1P 1P 2P P H 2P 1P ′ 5P 8P ′ 5P6 3P 1P 1P P H Figure 1: Degenerations of 1P6 and 5P 8P ′ 3P 1P ′ 3P 9P 2P 4P 3P 2P 1P2 P H Figure 2: Degenerations of 2P6, 3P6, and 4P In particular, one should replace κ3 with κ for the P2 systems. 19P ′ H 6P 1P ′ 5P 7P 7P P H 1P P H 6P 2P ′ 1P 8P ′ 1P 8P6 4P P H 1P P H Figure 3: Degenerations of 6P6, 7P6, and 8P The bold font in iPk denotes the Painlev´e systems from Appendices A.1 – A.5, the thin font is used for systems with Okamoto integrals, and the Hamiltonian systems are denoted as PH k . In order to get degeneracies for the systems, obtained by the transposition from the systems from Appendix A.1, we need to replace each system in Figures 1 – 3 with its transposed version. We see that the trees corresponding to P6 systems from different orbits (see Subsection 5.1.1) have no intersections. All 18 systems listed in the appendices are presented in Figures 1 – 3. No additional new systems were obtained by degenerations, so the class of systems found in this paper is closed with respect to the limiting transitions. These limiting transitions can be also extended to the Lax pairs. In most cases, formulas from Subsection 4.1 in [6] are applicable, but in the cases P5 → P ′ 3 and P4 → P2 it is necessary to supplement them with a gauge transformation A˜ (z, λ) = g A(z, λ) g −1 + ∂λg g− , B˜ (z, λ) = g B(z, λ) g −1 + ∂zg g− , where g = z µ I and g = zµ ε− I, respectively. The constant µ depends on the choice of a particular system of P5 or P4 type. 6 Conclusion We found all non-abelian Painlev´e systems whose auxiliary autonomous systems have first integrals and symmetries. We believe that these systems enjoy the Painlev´e property. It was shown in [4, 3, 7] that in the P1, P2, and P4 cases they satisfy the Painlev´e-Kovalevskaya test. We constructed isomonodromic Lax pairs for multiparametric families of P2 – P6 systems containing all the systems obtained in this paper. As long as we assume that the coefficients of non-abelian polynomials are scalar constants, all systems are GL(m) invariant and we may consider their restriction on the invariants of GL(m)-action. It turns out that all restricted systems of the above families coincide with each other. A comparison of the results from [7] and Subsection 5.2.3 shows that in order to choose from these families those systems that have the Painlev´e property, one can assume the existence of symmetries for the auxiliary autonomous systems. The situation changes drastically if the constant coefficients themselves are non-abelian. Examples of such Painlev´e systems were found in [4, 15, 2, 7, 5]. We hope that a systematic construction of such systems can be carried out by simultaneous non-abelianization of the coefficients of the autonomous systems found in this paper and their symmetries. We are going to devote a separate paper to the search for systems of the Painlev´e type with non-abelian coefficients and the study of the properties of the corresponding autonomous systems. 20Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to V.

The corresponding scalar autonomous system is Hamiltonian with H = u v 2 + κ2u v + κ1uv + κ3u + κ4zu−1. (35) A non-abelian generalization of the autonomous system reads as    du dt = a1u 2v + (2 − a1 − a2)uvu + a2vu2 + κ1u + κ2u , dv dt = b1uv2 − (2 + b1 + b2)vuv + b2v 2u − κ1v + c1uv + (−2κ2 − c1)vu − κ3 + κ4zu−2, (36) where ai, bi, c1, κi ∈ C. Proposition 13. a) A system of the form (36) admits a non-abelianization of integrals H and H iff b1 = −a1, b2 = −a2. b) If the system additionally possesses a non-abelianization of the symmetry (5) of degree 7, then it belongs to one of the following lists: i) Appendix A.7 from [5], 23ii) Appendix C.1 from [6], iii) (up to the transposition τ) ( u ′ = 2u v + κ1u + κ2u , v ′ = −2uv2 − κ1v − 3κ2uv + κ2vu − κ3 + κ4zu− ; 1P ′ (D7) ( u ′ = 2u2v + κ1u + κ2u , v ′ = −2uv2 − κ1v − κ2uv − κ2vu − κ3 + κ4zu− . 2P ′ (D7) The transposition τ acts on the parameters of system (36) as follows τ (a1, a2, c1) = (a2, a1, −c1 − 2κ2). Systems from the list iii) are non-equivalent with respect to τ. There non-equivalent systems with Okamoto integral were obtained in [6]. One Hamiltonian system can be found in [5]. The P ′ (D7) system related to Hamiltonian (35) has an isomonodromic Lax pair [10] of the form (33). Matrices A0(z), A−1(z), A−2(z), B1, and B0(z) are equivalent to A0 = 0 κ4 zu−1 , A−1 = − uv + κ1 u κ2uv + κ3 −uv , A−2 = −κ2 0 , B1 = 0 κ4 z , B0 = z − κ2u −u 0 . One can generalize this pair to the non-commutative case for non-abelian Painlev´e- ′ (D7) systems satisfying the item 3 from Assumption 1 as follows. Proposition 14. Suppose that a non-abelian system of the P ′ (D7) type admits an auxiliary autonomous system defined by the item a) from Proposition 13. Then it is equivalent to (4), where the Lax pair has the form (33) with A0 = 0 κ4 zu−1 , A−1 = − uv + κ1 u κ2vu + κ3 −vu , A−2 = −κ2 0 , B1 = 0 κ4 u −1 , B0 = z − κ2u −u 0 + q(z, u, v) I, z q(z, u, v) = −a1uv + a2vu + c1u.

      "1. Introduction Shuo-Yen et al. [1] prove constructively that by linear coding alone, the rate at which a message reaches each node can achieve the individual max-flow bound. Also, provide realization of transmission scheme and practically construct linear coding approaches for both cyclic and acyclic networks. [16] shows that network coding is necessity to multicast two bits per unit time from a source to destinations. It also showed that the output flow at a given node is obtained as a linear combination of its input flows. The content of any information flowing out of a set of non-source nodes can be derived from the accumulated information that has flown into the set of nodes. Shuo-Yen et al. described an approach on network information flow and improved the performance in data broadcasting in allto-all communication in order to increase the capacity or the throughput of the network. [7] selected the linear coefficients in a finite field of opportune size in a random way. In this paper packetizing and buffering are explained in terms of encoding vector and buffering the received packets. It showed that each node sends packets obtained as a random linear combination of packets stored in its buffer and each node receives packets which are linear combinations of source packets and it stores them into a matrix. While Widmer et. al. [8] gave an approach with energy efficient broadcasting in network coding. Subsequent work by Fragouli et. al. [9] gave two heuristics and stated that each node in the graph is associated with a forwarding factor. A source node transmits its source symbols (or packets) with some parameters bounded by this forwarding factor. And when a node receives an innovative symbol, it broadcast a linear combination over the span of the received coding vector. [10] deals with network coding of a single message over an acyclic network. Network coding over undirected networks was introduced by [11] and this work was followed by [12], [13]. The network codes that involve only linear mapping with a combination of global and local encoding mapping involves linear error-correction code [14], [15], [16] and [17] have also been presented. We present an approach for parallel network in which network coding is employed to perform communication amid the nodes. The association among network coding and communication algorithm establishes a more efficient way to transfer data among the nodes. We consider parallel multi-source multicast framework with correlated sources on MMT architecture [18]. We use a randomized approach in which, other than the receiving nodes all nodes perform random linear mapping from inputs on outputs (see figure 1). In each incoming transmissions from source node, the destination node has knowledge of overall linear combination of that data set from source. This information is updated at each coding node, by applying the same linear mapping to the coefficient vectors as applied to the information signals. As an example, assume that in a directed parallel network (Ň) the source node Þ1 (unique node, without any incoming at that instant of time) sends a set of two bits (đ1, đ2) to node Þ2, Þ3 and Þ4, Þ7 (figure 1). Network (Ň) in figure 1 is used to show information multicast with network coding at each node. Node Þ multicast data set (đ1, đ2) to destination nodes Þ3 and Þ7. Any receiving non-destination node, truncheons randomly chosen coefficient of finite fields with the received data before transferring to other nodes. The compressive transmission throughout network (Ň) is heralded in following steps of Table 1. IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May ISSN (Online): 1694www.IJCSI.org Fig. 1.A network (Ň) used, as an example, to explain LNC with coefficient added at each data transfer from different nodes (the network has seven nodes Þ1, Þ2...Þ7 and nine edges Þ1 Þ2, Þ1 Þ4, Þ2 Þ5, Þ4 Þ5, Þ Þ3, Þ5 Þ6, Þ4 Þ5, Þ6 Þ3, Þ6 Þ7 directed in this order). (đ1, đ2) is the set of data being multicast to destinations, and coefficients ζ1, ζ2…ζ6 are randomly chosen elements of a finite field. Each link represents the data transmission.

It is also right to say that the flow of information and flow of physical commodities are two different things [1]. So, the coding of information does not increase the information content. The capacity of a network to transmit information from the source to destination can become higher if the coding scheme becomes wider but it is limited to max-flow for a very wide coding scheme [1]. Now, as parallel networks contribute in data communication within several nodes in parallel, it is required to have higher capacity of such networks to transmit information. In senseto increase capacity of data communication in parallel networks we have implemented network coding on parallel architecture (MMT). To examine the performance of this network with network coding we have implemented this approach with existing All-to-All Broadcast algorithm (AAB) [19] on this architecture. In consecutive sections we have also shown that this approach has reduced the chance of error and increased the capacity of network to transmit data between nodes. For parallel transmission of information linearity of coding makes encoding (at source) and decoding (at receiving end) easy to contrivance. We do not address the problem which may or may not occur because of this approach, but have identified the possibilities of errors after implementation. The remaining paper is organized in five sections. In section second our basic model and preliminaries are illustrated. In basic model, notions used for linear–code multicast in parallel architecture (LCM-PA) and definitions are explained. In section third, implementation of AAB on parallel network-MMT is explained. In section forth, LNC is implemented using LCM-PA, it is illustrated using AAB algorithm on MMT [19]. The fifth section is used for results and simulations. In section sixth, we are concluding this paper and future scope of LCM-PA is given in this section. The basic definition, theorems and lemma used in this paper are explained in appendix. 2. Model and Preliminaries A parallel network is represented as a directed graph G (V, E), where V is the set of nodes in network and E is the set of links, such that, from node i to j for all (i, j)אE, where node i and j are called the origin and destination, respectively, of link (i, j), information can be sent noiselessly. Each link l א E is associated with a nonnegative real number cl representing its transmission capacity in bits per unit time. The origin and destination of a link lא E are denoted as o(l) and d(l), respectively, where o(l) ≠ d(l) ׊ l א E is obtained as a coding function of information received at o(l). There are r discrete memoryless information source processes X1, X2...Xr, which are random binary sequences. The processors may change according to the parallel architecture. We denote the Slepian–Wolf region of the sources ࣬SW = ൛ሺܴ1 , ܴ2 ,…,ܴrሻ : ∑௜אௌ ܴi > H ሺܺS |ܺௌ೎ሻ ׊ ܵ ك ሼ1, 2, … , ݎ ሽൟ Where, XS = ൫ܺi , ܺi2,…,ܺi|S|൯, ݅k אS, k = 1… |S|. Source process Xi is generated at node a(i), and multi-cast to all nodes j א b(i), where a : { 1,…, r} → V and b : {1,…, r} → 2V are arbitrary mappings. For parallel architectures, we have considered the same approach to implement the network coding. In this paper, we consider the (multisource) multicast case where b(i) = {β1,…, βd} for all iא] 1, r]. The node a(1),…, a(r) are called source nodes and the β1,…, βd are called receiver nodes, or receivers. For simplicity, we assume subsequently that a(i) ≠ βj׊iא [1, r], jא] 1, d]. For data communication at different step, the source and destination nodes changes according to the flow of data in the algorithm. If the receiving node is able to encode the complete source information, than connection requirements are fulfilled. For parallel communication, we have used these sets of connection requirements for level of communication, which is encoded at each level (step of algorithm). To specify a multicast connection problem we used 1) a graph G (V, E), 2) a set of multicast connection requirements, and 3) a set Þ ζ5(ζ1đ1+ζ2đ2) + ζ6 (ζ3đ1+ζ4đ2) ζ1đ1+ζ2đ Þ1 ζ3đ1+ζ4đ (đ1, đ2) Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ6IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May ISSN (Online): 1694www.IJCSI.org of link capacity {cl | l א E}.To explain linear–code multicast (LCM) with parallel communication network, we present some terminologies, definitions and assumptions. Conventions: 1) In MMT network, the edges e.g., (Þ1, Þ2) א)E) denotes that (Þ1, Þ2) is a bi-directed edge [18], but this edge may act as unidirectional depending on the algorithm. 2) The information unit is taken as a symbol in the base field, i.e., 1 symbol in the base field can be transmitted on a channel every unit time [1]. Definitions: 1) The communication in MMT network is interblock and intrablock [18]. LNC is implemented in blocks first and then in complete network. 2) A LCM on a communication network (G, o(l)) is an assignment of vector space v (Þi) to every node Þi and a vector v (Þi, Þj) to every edge Þi, Þj [1] such that v(o(l)) = Ω; v(Þi, Þj) א v (Þi) for every edge Þi, Þj; for any collection א d(l) of nonsource nodes in the network ۃሼݒሺÞ1ሻ: Þ1 א ݀ሺ݈ሻሽۄ ൌ ۃሼݒሺÞi, Þj ሻ: Þi ב݀ሺ݈ሻ, Þj א ݀ሺ݈ሻሽۄ Assumptions: 1) Each source process Xi has one bit per unit time entropy rate for independent source process, while larger rate sources are modeled as multiple sources. 2) Modeling of sources as linear combinations of independent source processes for linearly correlated sources. 3) Links with lא E is supposed having a capacity cl of one bit per unit time for both independent as well as linear correlated sources. 4) Both cyclic (networks with link delays because of information buffering at intermediate nodes; operated in a batched [2] fashion, burst [11], or pipelined [12]) and acyclic networks (networks whose nodes are delay-free i.e. zero-delay) are considered for implementation of LNC on parallel networks, by analyzing parallel network to be a cyclic or acyclic. 5) We are repeatedly using either of these terms processor and nodes, throughout the paper, which signify common significance. The network may be analyzed to be acyclic or cyclic using scalar algebraic network coding framework [13]. Let us consider the zero-delay case first, by representing the equation ܻj ൌ ∑ሼ௜:௔ሺ௜ሻ ୀ௢ሺ௝ሻሽ ܽi, j ܺi ൅ ∑ ݂l,j ܻl. ሼ௟:ௗሺ௟ሻୀ௢ሺ௝ሻሽ The sequence of length-u blocks or vectors of bits, which are treated as elements of a finite field Fq, q = 2u . The information process Yj transmission on a link j is formed as a linear combination, in Fq, of link j's inputs, i.e., source processes Xi for which a(i) = o(j) and random processes Yl for which d(l) = o(j).

Memory is needed, for link delays on network for multicast, at receiver (or source) nodes, but a memoryless operation suffices at all other nodes [12].

This shows that maxflow(Þ3) is an upper bound on the amount of information received at Þ3 when a LCM ߰ is used [1]. 3. Implementation of AAB on Parallel Network In this section, we implement AAB on parallel network (MMT). For implementation, we are using AAB algorithm, which involves ten steps to completely transfer and receive information of all processors to all processors in MMT [19] and implement LNC using LCM-PA model in next section. We consider the MMT network with n = 8, where n is number of processors and in algorithm and we consider N= n ൈn2, nN and a block = nൈn= row× column. The time taken to transfer and receive all information at each step of algorithm is listed in [19] involved in AAB algorithm. For implementation of AAB on MMT network, first we state a reason for using this network. MMT network is better than other traditional parallel networks (we compared few of them e.g., Multi-Mesh (MM) [20, 21]) based on the topological properties of MMT, which is comparable regarding efficiency parameters. A comparison of these networks, based on some parameters, is given in figure 4 and a comparison between 2D Sort on MM and MMT for different values of processor is given in figure 5. Fig. 4. Comparison of MMT and MM on the basis of Communication links, Solution of Polynomial Equations, One to All and Row & Column Broadcast. Fig. 5. A comparison between 2D Sort on MM and MMT for different values of processor. Table 2 [18, 22] shows characteristics of various processor organizations based on some of the network optimization parameters. From all these network architectures MMT is more optimum network to be used. Table 2: Characteristics of Various Processor Organizations.

For clarity in explaining each step of algorithm, we have used either one row or one column, based on the algorithm, to show the flow of data in each step. For every step the data flow varies, so for each step different algorithms are used. Figure 6 shows first row in first block of the network and the connectivity between the processors is based on the topological properties of MMT [18]. We have considered that each processor is having a Working Array (WA) which consist of the processor index (Pn) and information associated with that processor (In). The size of working array is based on the size of network used, i.e. for n = 8, the size of WA = 8. 0. 1. 2. 3.

Note: At the end of this step, all the processors of each block contains information of all processors of the network. 4. Implementing LNC on AAB using MMT In this section we implement network coding for each step to make the communication faster and increase the rate of information transmitted from each node. We consider network as delay-free (acyclic) and o(l) ≠ d(l). The algorithm results are analyzed later with n= 8 processors. For each step independent and different algorithms are used (see section IV) and linear coding is implemented with each algorithm. According to algorithm 1, data from IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May ISSN (Online): 1694www.IJCSI.org ζ2đ7+ ζ3đ6 + ζ6đ ζ4đ ζ3đ ζ2đ ζ1đ đ1 đ2 đ3 đ4 đ5 đ6 đ7 đ đ1 đ2 đ3 đ ζ1đ8+ ζ5đ đ ζ2đ7+ ζ3đ6 + ζ6đ3 ζ1đ8+ ζ4đ5 + ζ5đ4 + ζ7đ đ all processors are transferred with n = 8 and count = 1 to i.e, ሺ8/ሺ2 ൈ 1 – 1ሻሻ <݆  ሺ8/2 ൈ 1ሻ ൌ 8 <݆  4 , which means the processors Þ1, Þ2, Þ3 and Þ4 will receive data from Þ5, Þ6, Þ7 and Þ8, shown in figure 10.

(b) Shows the direction of flow of data in step 1 of AAB algorithm on MMT, Þ1, Þ2, Þ3and Þ4 are the processor receiving data and Þ5, Þ6, Þ7 and Þ8 are the sending processors. The dotted line distinguishes between the receiving and sending processors in first iteration of step 1. Step 1: Linear coding is implemented on Þ1, Þ2 and Þ3processors, as these are receiving a set of data form source processors Þ5, Þ6, Þ7 and Þ8 in first iteration. Processor Þ8 is source and Þ4 is its destination; Þ7 and Þ are sources and Þ3 is their destination; lastly in logn iteration i.e. (3 iteration for n = 8), Þ1 will receive data from Þ2 and Þ3. After implementation of LNC according to LCM-PA on these sources and destinations, step 1 will work as in figure 11. During first iteration of AAB on MMT, LCM-PA will work as in figure 11 (a). Data from Þ5, Þ6, Þ7 and Þ8 is sent to Þ2, Þ3, Þ3 and Þ4 respectively. So, the complete set of data from all processors reached processor Þ1,i.e. after execution of step 1 all data, in a row, will reach its root processors, but due to LCM-PA the data reached Þ1 will have time complexity of ሺlog݊ െ 1ሻ, as one step is reduced during transfer of the data using LCM-PA model.

(b) Iteration second of step 1; data from processers Þ4 and Þ3is sent to processors to Þ2and Þ1respectively. (c) Iteration third of step 1; data from processers Þ2 is sent to processors Þ1. Step 2: The root processors of each row, ( Þ1 : root processor of first block and first row) will broadcast the data (from Þ1: ζ1đ8+ ζ2đ7 + ζ3đ6 +ζ4đ5 + ζ5đ4 + ζ6đ3 + ζ7đ2) to all the processors of respective row using intrablock links transfer, see figure 12. Fig. 12. The data from each row root processor is broadcasted to other processors of respective row in each block. The time complexity for this step will be reduced by n i.e., n(logn-1). This step is a broadcasting step in each block with intrablock links of MMT. At the end of this step, complete data from root processor is received by otherprocessors of that row. LCM-PA is applied at the same level as in step 1, but the size of data increases to n. Step 3: This step is similar to step 1, but in this step the data is broadcasted in column-wise order of each block. Linear coding is implemented on Þ11, Þ12 and Þ13processors, as these are receiving a set of data form source processors Þ15, Þ16, Þ17 and Þ18 in first iteration. Processor Þ18 is source and Þ14 is its destination; Þ17 and Þ16 are sources and Þ13 is their destination; lastly in logn iteration i.e. (3 iteration for n = 8), Þ11 will receive data from Þ12 and Þ13. After implementation LCM-PA on these sources and destinations, step 3 works as in figure 13. Step 4: In this step all the root processors of each column and each block, (Þ11: root processor of first block and first column) will broadcast the data (from Þ11: ζ1đ18+ ζ2đ17+ ζ3đ16+ ζ4đ15+ ζ5đ14 + ζ6đ13+ ζ7đ12) to all the processors of respective column using intrablock links transfer, see figure 14. The time complexity of this step is reduced by n2 i.e, n (logn-1) = n2logn-n2. The coefficient value (ζi) in step 4 is different from the coefficient value in step 1. Step 5: After step 4, each processors of respective columns contains information of all processors of that column. The step 5, perform the interblock communication using the horizontal interblock links which transfers this information (of all the blocks of respective rows) to the root processors (of respective block), and this requires one communication step (CS) [19]. The time complexity of this step will be same as of AAB i.e. 1CS. Step 6: Using step 3, for transferring information of all the processors in the column at the processors with P_ID (j=n), so the WA of all the processors is transferred in the Þ1 Þ2 Þ3 Þ4 Þ5 Þ6 Þ7 Þ The data from Þ1is broadcasted to other processors of this row (ζ1đ8+ ζ2đ7 + ζ3đ + ζ4đ5 + ζ5đ4 + ζ6đ + ζ7đ2) đ1 đ2 đ3 đ4 đ5 đ6 đ7 đ8IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 3, No. 1, May ISSN (Online): 1694www.IJCSI.org ζ4đ ζ2đ17 ζ1đ đ ζ3đ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ đ đ đ đ đ đ đ Þ Þ Þ Þ đ đ Þ ζ2đ17+ ζ3đ16 + ζ6đ Þ Þ Þ đ đ đ đ ζ1đ18+ ζ5đ ζ2đ17+ ζ3đ16 + ζ6đ13 ζ1đ18+ ζ4đ15 + ζ5đ14 + ζ7đ The data from Þ1is broadcastedtoother processors of this row Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ Þ11 (ζ1đ18+ ζ2đ17 + ζ3đ + ζ4đ15 + ζ5đ14 + ζ6đ + ζ7đ12) column in the order ݊/ሺ2ܿݑ݋݊ݐ –1ሻ ൏ ݆ ൑ ݊/ሺ2ܿݑ݋݊ݐሻ.

Results and Simulations The implementation of linear coding using AAB on MMT enables the sharing of data between multiple processors, at a time unit, more convenient and easy. As the algorithm becomes more complex, the involvement of processors also increases. For parallel architectures, important issue is to make these architectures more processor utilitarian, otherwise the processors in these architectures are idle, and all are not in use at every step of algorithms. Also, the involvement of coefficients used to broadcast data is high, compared to coefficients involvement after implementation of LCM-PA with AAB on MMT. This makes the algorithm less complex as fewer amounts of coefficients are used for broadcasting data using linear coding. While broadcasting the data in AAB, the time involved to communicate and deliver/receive data from different processors is more. The fall of time complexity at different number of processors shows that the architecture is possible with a set of processors having a combination which makes the algorithm to be implemented with positive results. The algorithm starts with the execution of each step in the order defined (as step 1... step 10), as the execution of each step starts the involvement of each processors also increases to broadcast data. In parallel processing the algorithm starts with active processor and involves other processors as it progresses [22]. Figure 15 illustrate the involvement of processors with average percentage of iteration in each step. Fig. 15.

The algorithm with LCM-PA approach, utilizes the maximum number of processors compared to without LCM-PA approach. So the utilization of processors in parallel architectures is also increases while using linear coding. 6. Conclusion and Future Work We have presented a LCM-PA, model of linear coding, on parallel architecture with efficient implementation of our approach on AAB algorithm on MMT, with comparative time complexity after implementation with LCM-PA. Our model is network independent and can be implemented on any parallel architecture with assumptions to be common as we have used in section second.Future work includes extensions to this approach and analyzing the complexity aspects by implementing with other parallel algorithms (e.g. Multi-Sort [23]). In addition, to make the extension of this approach with LCM-PA model it is needed to be implemented with other parallel algorithms to make vision of research more clear.

A parallel network in any of the phase of communication is said to be directed based on the flow of data with respect to the algorithm. Proof. A parallel network is said to be directed, when the flow of data is decided based on some parameters. As MMT network is bidirectional, in some part of communication it is using a specific orientation for communication while in some parts it may be reverse, based on the algorithm used to decide the communication. As an example consider algorithm 1 in which the communication is performed from greater processor index to lesser processor index, so the direction is different from algorithm 2 in which the root processor transfers data to other processors of respective rows. References [1] R.

      "1. Introduction Denote by Ug,n the moduli space of reduced but otherwise arbitrarily singular, connected, proper curves of genus g with n marked points. It is known to be representable by an algebraic stack, locally of finite type over Spec Z with quasicompact and finite diagonal [Smy13, Appendix B]. We will call this the moduli space of all curves. The moduli space of all curves is not particularly \"nice:\" it is known to possess many irreducible components, due to existence of non-smoothable curve singularities of various genera [Mum75, Pin74]. It is also known to be highly non-separated, as evidenced by the many alternate compactifications of the moduli space of smooth pointed curves Mg,n [FS10, Bat22, BB22, BKN23]. However, in this article we show that it has at least one nice geometric property: it is connected. Theorem 1.1. Ug,n is connected and the fibers of Ug,n → Spec Z are geometrically connected for all g, n ≥ 0. Our method is to construct a path in the moduli space of all curves from any curve to a curve with only smoothable singularities. We use in an essential way Ishii's theory of territories [Ish80] and its further development in [BGS24]. Ishii's underappreciated theorem [Ish80, Corollary 2] on connectedness of territories of local rings plays an especially important role. 2. Background Fix an algebraically closed field k for the remainder of the paper. Suppose B is the complete local ring of a reduced algebraic curve singularity, that is, B is a complete, reduced, local k-algebra of Krull dimension 1. Let A be the integral closure of B. Then we may identify A with Qm i=1 kJtiK, where m is the number of branches of the singularity. The conductor CondA/B of A over B is the largest ideal of A that is also an ideal of B. The conductor may be written CondA/B = (t c , . . . , tcm m ) for some vector of positive integers ~c = (c1, . . . , cn), called the conductances or branch conductances of the singularity. Their sum c we call the total conductance of the singularity. Let ∆ be the B-module A/B. It is a finite-dimensional k-vector space whose dimension δ we call the delta invariant of the singularity. Date: June 2024. 12 SEBASTIAN BOZLEE Modding out by the conductor, we obtain a subalgebra B := B/CondA/B of A~c,k := Ym k= k[ti]/(t ci i ) ∼= A/CondA/B such that A~c,k/B ∼= ∆ as B-modules. Thus for any curve singularity over k there is an associated subalgebra B of the finite k-algebra A~c,k of codimension δ. This subalgebra only depends on the choice of identification of A with Qm i=1 kJtiK. Since B is a local ring, we notice that B factors through the subalgebra A + ~c,k = {(fi(ti))i=1,...,m ∈ A~c,k | fi(0) = fj (0) for all i, j} of A~c,k where all \"constants\" are equal. (More geometrically, if ν : Ce → C is the normalization of a reduced curve, then a function on Ce can only descend to C if it is constant on the fibers of ν : Ce → C.) The codimension g of B in A + ~c,k is called the genus of the singularity, and it is equal to δ − (m − 1). Conversely, given a k-subalgebra B of A~c,k, we can form a subalgebra B′ = π − (B) of Qm i=1 kJtiK, where π : Qm i=1 kJtiK → A~c,k is the quotient map. Provided B factors through A + ~c,k, B′ will be a complete local reduced 1-dimensional k-algebra. Moreover, we have CondA/B′ ⊇ (t c , . . . , tcn n ). If B came from a ring B as in the paragraphs above, then this process recovers B up to isomorphism: B′ ∼= B. Therefore, to parametrize reduced curve singularities, it suffices to parametrize the subalgebras of fixed codimension in the following finite algebras. Definition 2.1. Let ~c = (c1, . . . , cm) be a tuple of positive integers. Let A~c = Ym i= Z[ti]/(t ci i ) and A + ~c = {(f1(t1), . . . , fm(tm)) ∈ A~c | fi(0) = fj (0) for all i, j}. We note A~c,k = A~c ⊗ k and A + ~c,k = A + ~c ⊗ k. The subalgebras of such algebras are parametrized by moduli schemes called territories, originally introduced by Ishii for k-algebras in the context of Noetherian k-schemes. We start by defining an appropriate moduli functor. Definition 2.2. (See [Ish80, Definition 1], [BGS24, Section 2]) Let S be a scheme and A a finite locally free sheaf of OS-algebras of rank n. Given an S-scheme f : T → S, a family of subalgebras of A of corank δ on T is a quasi-coherent OT -subalgebra B of f ∗A such that the quotient OT -module f ∗A /B is locally free of rank δ. We define a functor F δ A : (Sch/S) op → Set by: (i) If f : T → S is an S-scheme, F δ A (T → S) is the set of families of subalgebras of A of corank δ on T. (ii) If g : T → T ′ is a morphism of S-schemes, then F δ A (g) : F δ A (T ′ ) → F δ A (T) is defined by taking a family of subalgebras to its pullback.CONNECTEDNESS OF THE MODULI SPACE OF ALL REDUCED ALGEBRAIC CURVES Lemma 2.3. (See [Ish80, Theorem 1], [BGS24, Theorem 2.5]) Let S be a scheme and A a finite locally free sheaf of OS-algebras of rank n. The functor F δ A is represented by a closed S-subscheme Terδ A of Gr(n − δ, A ). In particular TerδA is locally projective over S. The reasoning at the beginning of this section implies that each isomorphism class of curve singularity over k is represented by a k-point of Terg A + ~c , where g is the genus of the singularity and ~c = (c1, . . . , cm) is its vector of branch conductances. The global analogue of the territory is defined as follows. We will apply this in the case that Xe is a family of smooth, possibly disconnected curves; then X will vary over the curves with normalization Xe such that the vanishing of the conductor CondX/X e is contained in Z. Definition 2.4. Suppose that πe : Xe → S is a locally quasiprojective family of schemes. Let ι : Z → Xe be a closed subscheme such that πe ◦ ι : Z → S is finite locally free of fixed rank. Write IZ/Xe for the sheaf of ideals of Z in Xe. Define a functor F δ Z/X/S e that assigns to an S-scheme T the set of diagrams XeT X T ν πeT π such that (i) ν is an affine morphism of schemes, (ii) the associated map of sheaves ν ♯ : OX → ν∗OX is injective, (iii) ν ♯ (OX) contains ν∗IZT /XT, (iv) letting ∆ = ν∗OXeT/ν♯(OX), the OT -module π∗∆ is locally free of rank δ. Restriction morphisms F δ Z/X/S e (T ′ ) → F δ Z/X/S e (T) are given by pullback. If Xe is a family of smooth, possibly disconnected, proper curves, and X is a family of connected curves, we call the family ν : Xe → X a family of equinormalized curves over T. Moduli of equinormalized curves are studied in more detail in [BGS24]. Although the data might seem more weighty, moduli of such diagrams are also parametrized by the territory of a finite locally free sheaf of algebras. Lemma 2.5. [BGS24, Theorem 4.3] With notation as above, the functor F δ Z/X/S e is representable by the scheme Terδ πe∗OZ which we also denote by Terδ Z/X/S e . The isomorphism of functors F δ Z/X/S e → Terδ πe∗OZ is given by sending a family XeT → X to π∗(ν ♯ (OX)/ν∗IZT /XT). In particular, if Ce is a smooth, possibly disconnected curve over k and Z is a closed subscheme consisting of points q1, . . . , qm with respective multiplicities c1, . . . , cm, then Terδ Z/C/e Spec k ∼= Terδ A~c,k . Therefore we can view Terδ A~c,k as parametrizing families of curves normalized by Ce with conductor locus contained in Z. Crucially for our main result, Ishii has shown that the territories Ter g A + ~c,k are connected.4 SEBASTIAN BOZLEE Definition 2.6. A chain of A k s is a nodal curve with irreducible components S1, . . . , Sr such that Si ∼= A k for all i, and for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r, #(Si ∩ Sj ) = ( 1 if j = i + i 0 else. Lemma 2.7. For any g and ~c, Terg A + ~c → Spec Z has geometrically connected fibers. More specifically, any two k-points of Terg A + ~c ,k are connected by an embedded chain of A k s. Proof. This follows from [Ish80, Corollary 2] and the fact that territories base change as expected: Terg A ×S T ∼= TergA ⊗SOT . By contrast, Terδ A~c is rarely connected. It has connected components corresponding to different choices of points to glue together, see below. Lemma 2.8. For any δ,~c, Terδ A~c is a disjoint union of products of territories of A + ~c . More precisely, Terδ A~c ∼= G P,g Y P ∈P Terg(P) A + ~c|P where the disjoint union varies over the partitions P of {1, . . . , m} together with functions g : P → N such that P P ∈P g(P) = δ − (m − 1). Proof. This follows from an identical proof to [BGS24, Theorem 3.8], after dropping the constraint of having the \"correct\" conductances. Tracing through the equivalences shows that if Ce is a smooth curve and Z is a closed subscheme consisting of points q1, . . . , qm with respective multiplicities c1, . . . , cm, then the summand of Terδ Z/C/e Spec k ∼= Terδ A~c,k indexed by (P, g) parametrizes the normalized curves ν : Ce → C obtained by gluing together, for each part P of P, the points qi whose indices lie in P to the curve singularity indicated by the Terg(P) A + ~c|P -coordinate. 3. Constructing the path Definition 3.1. Let n1, . . . , nm positive integers. Let Xn1,...,nm denote the singularity Spec k⊕ t n 1 kJt1K ⊕ · · · ⊕ t nm m kJtmK. The singularities Xn1,...,nm are known variously as universal singularities or partition singularities.[Ste93] We remark that Xn1,...,nm has m branches, branch conductances n1,. . ., nm, genus n1+· · ·+nm −m, and delta invariant n1+· · ·+nm −1. We also remark that Xn1,...,nm is the transverse union of the unibranch singularities Xni = Spec k[t i : i ≥ ni] for i = 1, . . . , m. Lemma 3.2. For any n1, . . . , nm, the singularity Xn1,...,nm is smoothable. Proof. It suffices to show that Xn1,...,nm is a limit of smoothable singularities. Let R = k[xi,j : i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , ni] and consider the subring B = R · 1 ⊕ Mm i= h(ti − xi,1)· · ·(ti − xni)i of A = Ym i= R[ti], where h(ti−xi,1)· · ·(ti−xi,ni)i denotes the ideal generated by (ti−xi,1)· · ·(ti−xi,ni) in R[ti]. The quotient A/B is a finite free R-module of rank n1 + · · · + nm − 1. (A basis is given byCONNECTEDNESS OF THE MODULI SPACE OF ALL REDUCED ALGEBRAIC CURVES the images of xi, . . . , x ni− i and (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . ,(0, . . . , 0, 1, 0).) It follows Spec B → Spec R is a flat family of affine curves. The generic fiber of Spec B → Spec R has one singularity obtained by gluing the points ti = xi,j to a single point transversally. This is an ordinary n1 + · · · + nm-fold point (i.e., the same singularity as that formed by the coordinate axes in A n1+···+nm.) Ordinary n1 + · · · + nm-fold points are smoothable singularities. It follows that the singularity Xn1,...,nm, which appears in the fiber over the point where all xi,j = 0, is a limit of smoothable singularities. Therefore it too is smoothable. Corollary 3.3. Each non-empty Terg A + ~c has a k-point corresponding to a smoothable singularity. Proof. In order that Terg A + ~c be non-empty, it is necessary that δ + 1 ≤ c.[AK70, Chapter VIII, Proposition 1.16] Suppose g as a non-negative integer and ~c = (c1, . . . , cm) is a vector of positive integers with sum c such that δ + 1 = g + m ≤ c. It follows g ≤ Pm i=1(ci − 1). As the latter is a sum of non-negative integers, we can find integers n1, . . . , nm with 1 ≤ ni ≤ ci for all i such that g = Pm i=1(ni − 1). Then Xn1,...,nm is a smoothable, m-branch singularity with genus g, and its ring of regular functions k ⊕ t n 1 kJt1K ⊕ · · · ⊕ t nm m kJtmK contains the ideal (t c , . . . , tcm m ). Quotienting by this ideal yields a subalgebra of A + ~c,k corresponding to Xn1,...,nm. This is the required point of Terg A + ~c . We now prove Theorem 1.1. Proof. Let (C, p1, . . . , pn) ∈ Ug,n(k) be an arbitrary reduced, connected, proper curve over k. Let ν : Ce → C be the normalization of C, and let pe1, . . . , pen ∈ Ce be lifts of p1, . . . , pn. Let Z = V (CondC/C e ) ⊆ Ce be the vanishing of the conductor ideal, and let q1, . . . , qm be the points of its support with respective multiplicities c1, . . . , cm. Observe that OZ ∼= A + ~c,k. Consider T = Terδ Z/C/e Spec k ∼= Terδ A~c,k . By Lemma 2.8, the point x = (ν : Ce → C, pe1, . . . , pen) of T factors through an open and closed subscheme of T isomorphic to Q P ∈P Terg(P) A + ~c|P ,k for some partition P of {1, . . . , m} and function g : P → N. We know by Lemma 2.7 that this space is connected by embedded chains of A k s. In particular, using Corollary 3.3, and interpreting the chain of A k 's as parametrizing families of equinormalized curves, there is a family of equinormalized curves over a chain of A k s connecting x to an equinormalized curve (ν ′ : Ce′ → C ′ , pe ′ , . . . , pe ′ n ) with only smoothable singularities. Forgetting the normalization results in a family of curves in Ug,n connecting (C, p1, . . . , pn) to a curve (C ′ , p′ , . . . , p′ n ) in the closure of Mg,n. As Mg,n is connected with geometrically connected fibers over Spec Z, Theorem 1.1 follows.

      "1 Introduction The Segre cubic is a classical three-dimensional variety with many interesting properties. For example, it is a compactification of the moduli space of configurations of six points on the projective line (see [6, §2]) and its dual variety, called the Igusa quartic, is a compactification of the moduli space of certain abelian surfaces (see [13, Theorem 2]). Birational geometry of the Segre cubic was extensively studied, for example, its small resolutions were described (see [8]). The aim of this article to study equivariant birational rigidity of forms of the Segre cubic. Equivariant birational rigidity of the Segre cubic itself over algebraically closed field of characteristic zero was studied by the author in the paper [1]. We show that for every field of characteristic zero there is only one form of the Segre cubic over this field which is G-birationally rigid (see Definition 3.2), and only for the following groups: S6, A6, S5 and A5, where S6 is the full automorphism group and groups S5 and A5 are embedded into S6 in the standard way (see Definition 2.3). Moreover, in these cases the form of the Segre cubic is G-birationally superrigid. These results can be useful, for example, for classification of finite subgroups of three-dimensional Cremona groups over fields of characteristic zero. We wxpect that these results are valid also over fields of characteristic p > 5. Also we prove that all forms of the Segre cubic have a point defined over the basic field, and all of them are cubic hypersurfaces. Special attention is given to the case of the field of real numbers. In this article we use the following notation for groups: by Cn we denote the cyclic group of order n; by D2n we denote the dihedral group of order 2n; by Sn we denote the symmetric group of rank n; by An we denote the alternating group of rank n. For an arbitrary field K by Ksep we denote its separable closure. This work is supported by the Russian Science Foundation under grant No 1811-00121.

Trepalin for useful discussions and comments. 12 Biregular geometry of the forms of the Segre cubic Definition 2.1. The Segre cubic over the field K of characteristic zero or p > is a three-dimensional variety SK, which can be explicitely given by the following system of equations in P K : X i= xi = X i= x i = 0. (2.1.1) Usually, if it doesn't lead to misunderstanding, we will omit the index and denote the Segre cubic by S. We will call a variety X defined over an arbitrary field K of characteristic zero or p > 5 a form of the Segre cubic if XKsep = X ⊗K Spec Ksep is isomorphic to the Segre cubic over the field Ksep. If the field K is the field of real numbers R, we will call the variety X a real form of the Segre cubic. Remark 2.2. Note that equations (2.1.1) make sence over an arbitrary field, so there is at least one form of the Segre cubic over an arbitrary field. We will use the following well-known facts about the Segre cubic (see, for example, [6, §2]): • the automorphism group Aut(S) is isomorphic to S6 and acts by permutations of standard coordinates; • the singular set of the Segre cubic S consists of 10 ordinary double points, all of them form an Aut(S)-orbit and one of them has coordinates (1 : 1 : 1 : −1 : −1 : −1); • the variety S contains exactly 15 planes which form an Aut(S)-orbit, one of them can be given by equations x1 + x2 = x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 = 0 in standard coordinates; • every singular point of S lies on 6 planes and every plane on S contains exactly 4 singular points. In other words, singular points and planes form a (106, 154)-configuration in notation of [7]. The automorphism group of such a configuration is isomorphic to S6 and is induced by the automorphism group Aut(S) (see, for example, [2, Lemma 2.1]). Definition 2.3. We will say that a subgroup A5 ⊂ Aut(S) or S5 ⊂ Aut(S) is standard if it preserves some hyperplane {xi = 0}. In the sequel we will need the following easy facts about elements of order 2 and certain subgroups of the group S6. Lemma 2.4. The element (1 2) acting on the (106, 154)-configuration has exactly 4 fixed singular points and 3 invariant planes and its centralizer is isomorphic to C2×S4. The element (1 2)(3 4) acting on the (106, 154)-configuration has exactly 2 fixed singular points and 3 invariant planes and its centralizer is isomorphic to C2 × (C 2 ⋊ C2) ≃ C2 × D8. The element (1 2)(3 4)(5 6) acting on the (106, 154)- configuration has exactly 4 fixed singular points and 7 invariant planes and its centralizer is isomorphic to C 2 ⋊S3. The stabilizer of a singular point is isomorphic to S 3 ⋊ C2, the stabilizer of a plane is isomorphic to S4 × C2. A non-standard subgroup S5 acts on the set of planes with two orbits of length 5 and 10 respectively. 2Proof. Simple direct computations. Corollary 2.5. Every real form of the Segre cubic has a singular point defined over the base field R. Proof. Let X be a real form of the Segre cubic. Consider an action of the complex conjugation σ on the (106, 154)-configuration of singular points and planes on the Segre cubic XC. Since σ acts as an element of order 2 or 1, by Lemma 2.4 we have a σ-invariant singular point. For an arbitrary field K we have the following assertion. Lemma 2.6. A form X of the Segre cubic over the field K contains a K-point if and only if the variety X is isomorphic to a cubic hypersurface in P K . Proof. Assume that the variety X has a point defined over the field K. Then the group Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/K) coincides with its subgroup Pic(X) (see, for example, [14, Theorem 9.1]). In particular, the divisor class − 2KX is defined over K and its linear system induces an embedding of X into P K as a cubic hypersurface. Due to [4, Proposition 3.2] the converse statement is also true. As a consequence, every real form of the Segre cubic is a cubic itself. Let us show, that analogous result is valid over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero or p > 5. For this purpose we need the following lemma. Lemma 2.7. (cf. [4, Lemma 2.3]) Let K be an arbitrary field of characteristic different from 2, and let L/K be a composite of quadratic extensions of the field K. Let X be a variety over the field K such that XL is isomorphic to a cubic in P L . Suppose that XL has an L-point. Then X has a K-point. Proof. There is a sequence of quadratic field extensions K = L0 ⊂ L1 ⊂ L2 ⊂ ... ⊂ Ln = L. By the induction it is enough to consider the case when L is a quadratic extension of K. Since the characteristic of K differs from 2, the extension K ⊂ L is a Galois extension. We know that the cubic XL contains an L-point. This point is either defined over K or its Gal(L/K)-orbit consists of two points. In the second case the line l passing through these points is defined over K. If this line lies on XL then X contains every K-point of the line l. If the line l doesn't lie on XL then the third intersection point of the line l and the cubic XL is defined over K. Lemma 2.8. Let K be a field of characteristic zero or p > 5. Then every form of the Segre cubic over the field K has a K-point and isomorphic to a cubic hypersurface. Proof. Let X be a form of the Segre cubic. There is the exact sequence 0 → Pic(X) → Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/K) → Br(K), see, for example, [9, Problem 3.3.5(iii)]. If the divisor class − 2KX is not defined over the field K, then the group Pic(X) is embedded into Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/K) as a subgroup of index 2, so we define canonically an element of order 2 in the Brauer group Br(K). Since this element has a representation as a tensor product of 3quaternion algebras over the field K (see [12, Theorem 11.5]), there is a composite L of quadratic extensions of the field K such that our algebra splits over this extension. Thus the corresponding embedding Pic(XL) → Pic(XKsep ) Gal(K sep/L) is an isomorphism. The linear system | − 2KXL | induces an embedding of XL into P L as a cubic hypersurface. By Lemma 2.6 there is an L-point on XL. By Lemma 2.7 there is a K-point on X. In particular, by Lemma 2.6, the variety X is isomorphic to a cubic hypersurface in P K . Now we return to the field of real numbers. Proposition 2.9. There are exactly 4 real forms of the Segre cubic S up to isomorphism. All of them are three-dimensional cubic hypersurfaces and rational over the field R. Proof. It is well-known (see, for example, [15, Chapter III, §1]) that there is a oneto-one correspondence between the forms of a real variety X and the elements of H (Gal(C/R), Aut(XC)). The latter set, in turn, is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all homomorphisms Gal(C/R) ≃ C2 → S6 ≃ Aut(XC) up to conjugation. Such homomorphisms are defined by conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 or 1 in the group S6. There are exactly four such classes: the trivial permutation and conjugacy classes of the transposition (1 2), the product of two transpositions (1 2)(3 4) and the product of three transpositions (1 2)(3 4)(5 6). Let X be a real form of the Segre cubic S. By Corollary 2.5 the variety X contains an R-point. By Lemma 2.6 the variety X is isomorphic to a cubic in P R . This cubic contains a singular point defined over the field R and the projection from such a point gives us a birational map from the variety X to P R . We say that a real form X of the Segre cubic is of type I (resp., II, III or IV) if the image of the complex conjugation in the group Aut(S) ≃ S6 is the trivial permutation (resp., is conjugate to the transposition (1 2), is conjugate to the permutation (1 2)(3 4) or is conjugate to the permutation (1 2)(3 4)(5 6)). Remark 2.10. The form of the Segre cubic of type I can be obtained in the following way: blow up five R-points of P R in general position and contract proper transforms of lines passing through pairs of points. The obtained variety is the required form of the Segre cubic. It also can be defined explicitely by the equations (2.1.1). Note that in this case there is an action of the group S5 on P 3 with five marked points and the construction is S5-equivariant. The forms of type IV and III can be constructed in a similar way, but we need to blow up P R in 3 real points and one pair of conjugated points or one real point and two pairs of conjugated points in general position respectively. One can easily see that we obtain exactly forms of type IV and III by calculation of numbers of singular Rpoints and planes defined over R in both cases. The form of type II has no such a transformation into P R , but by Proposition 2.9 a transformation of other type exists. In the following proposition we describe automorphism groups of all forms of the Segre cubic. 4Proposition 2.11. The automorphism group of a form of the Segre cubic over an arbitrary field K of characteristic zero or p > 5 coincides with the centralizer of the image of the Galois group Gal(Ksep/K) in the automorphism group of the (106, 154)-configuration of singular points and planes on S. The automorphism group of the form of the Segre cubic of type I (resp., II, III or IV) is isomorphic to S6 (resp., C2 × S4, C2 × D8 or C 2 ⋊ S3). Proof. Let X be a form of the Segre cubic over K. There is a canonical embedding of the automorphism group of X into the automorphism group of the (106, 154)- configuration of singular points and planes on XKsep ≃ S and the canonical map from the Galois group Gal(Ksep/K) into the same group S6. Since all automorphisms defined over the base field commute with the action of the Galois group, the image of such embedding is contained in the centralizer of the image of the Galois group Gal(Ksep/K). Let g ∈ S6 be an element of the automorphism group of the (106, 154)-configuration which commutes with the image of some element σ ∈ Gal(Ksep/K). Let eg be the corresponding automorphism of the variety XKsep . Then ge −1 ◦ σ−1 ◦ ge ◦ σ is a linear transformation of P Ksep which fixes all singular points of the variety XKsep . Since there are 10 singular points and they are in general enough position this linear map is trivial. Thus σ −1 ◦ ge ◦ σ = ge. If g commutes with all elements of the image of Gal(Ksep/K) then eg is defined over the base field K. As a consequence, the embedding of the group Aut(X) into the centralizer of the image of the Galois group is an isomorphism. The second assertion is a consequense of Lemma 2.4. 3 Birational geometry of the forms of the Segre cubic For the classification of finite subgroups in Cremona groups it is important to study G-birational rigidity of Fano varieties. Definition 3.1. Let X and Y be a varieties with an action of a finite group G. We call a rational map f : X 99K Y a G-equivariant map if there exist an automorphism τ of the group G such that the following diagram commutes for every g ∈ G: X f ❴❴❴ / g Y τ(g) X f ❴❴❴ /Y We denote the group of G-equivariant automorphisms of a G-variety X by AutG(X) and the group of G-equivariant birational selfmaps of a G-variety X by BirG(X). Definition 3.2. Let G be a finite subgroup of the automorphism group of a Fano variety X with terminal singularities, and suppose that X is a GQ-factorial variety and rk Pic(X) G = 1. The variety X is called G-birationally rigid if there is no birational map from X to another G-Mori fibration. If one also has BirG(X) = AutG(X) then X is called G-birationally superrigid. There is the following theorem: 5Theorem 3.3. (see [1, Proposition 4.1, Theorem 4.8]) Let G ⊂ Aut(S) be a subgroup of the automorphism group of the Segre cubic over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Then the variety S is G-birationally rigid if and only if G containts a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ Aut(S). Moreover, in this case S is G-birationally superrigid. The next theorem is an analog of the previous statement over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. Theorem 3.4. Let X be a form of the Segre cubic over some field K of characteristic zero, and let G ⊂ Aut(X) be a subgroup. Assume that rk Pic(X) G = 1 and that the variety X is GQ-factorial and G-birationally rigid. Then the variety X can be explicitely given by equations (2.1.1) and G contains a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6. Conversely, the variety given by the equations (2.1.1) is A5-birationally superrigid with respect to a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ Aut(X). Proof. As were noticed earlier, there is a canonical embedding G ⊂ S6 where S is the automorphism group of the (106, 154)-configuration. Denote by H ⊂ S6 the image of the Galois group Gal(K/K) in S6. By Proposition 2.11 the group G is contained in the centralizer of the group H. Let F ⊂ S6 be a subgroup generated by G and H. If F does not contain a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6 then it is not hard to check directly with computer that the group F lies in one of the following subgroups: non-standard subgroup S5 ⊂ S6, S 3 ⋊ C2 (which is the stabilizer of a point), S4 × C2 (which is the stabilizer of a plane on S) or S4 × C2 (which is conjugate to the following group: S4 acts by permutations of coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4 while C permutes x5 and x6 in standard coordinates). Consider an action of a non-standard subgroup S5 ⊂ S6 on the set of planes on S. By Lemma 2.4 it has two orbits of length 5 and 10 respectively. The sum of all planes in the first orbit is not a QCartier divisor since the group Pic(X) is a primitive sublattice in the group Cl(X) and is generated by the class of hyperplane section while the sum of 5 planes is not a integer multiple of a hyperplane section in Cl(X). Thus in this case the G-variety is not GQ-factorial. In the second case the projection from a singular point which is invariant with respect to F gives us an equivariant birational map to P K . In the third case an F-invariant plane is a Weil divisor which is not Q-Cartier by the same reason as in the first case. But this is impossible since we assume that the variety X is GQ-factorial. Let us consider the forth case. Let the group S4×C2 act on P K as was described above. Then there is an S4 × C2-orbit that consists of the following planes on S: x1 + x2 = x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 = 0, x1 + x3 = x2 + x4 = x5 + x6 = 0, x1 + x4 = x2 + x3 = x5 + x6 = 0. They form a hyperplane section of S given by the equation x5 + x6 = 0. The only common point of these three planes p = (0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 1 : −1) is defined over K and is G-invariant. Since the action of the group G on the hyperplane is a projectivisation of a four-dimensional representation of the group G and the invariant point p correspondes to a one-dimensional subrepresentation, we can find a three-dimensional subrepresentation of G as well. The corresponding G-invariant plane is defined over the base field. The projection from such a plane gives us a 6structure of G-equivariant cubic fibration. Now we can apply a G-equivariant resolution of singularities and relative G-equivariant minimal model program and obtain a G-birational transformation into a G-Mori fibration with the base of positive dimension. So the group F contains a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6, hence it is isomorphic to one one the following groups: A5, S5, A6 or S6. The groups G and H are normal subgroups of F, all elements of G commute with all elements of H and they generate the whole group F. Obviously, it is possible only in the following case: one of the groups G and F coincides with F while the other one is trivial. If the group G is trivial then the projection from any plane in P 4 which is defined over the base field gives us a structure of fibration by cubic surfaces. If the group H is trivial then the variety X can be given by the equations (2.1.1) and the group G contains a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6. Conversely, assume that the form X of the Segre cubic is given by the equations (2.1.1) and the group G contains a standard subgroup A5 ⊂ S6 ≃ Aut(X). Then by [1, Lemma 4.6, Lemma 4.7] the pair (X, µM) is canonical for every µ and every movable G-invariant linear subsystem M ⊂ | − µKX|. Hence by the Noether–Fano inequalities (see, for example, [5, Theorem 2.4] and [3, Theorem 3.2.6] in a G-equivariant situation) the variety X is G-birationally superrigid. Corollary 3.5. Among all real forms of the Segre cubic only the form of type I can be G-birationally rigid and only if the group G contains a standard subgroup A5. In this case it is G-birationally superrigid. Remark 3.6. It looks like the analogous statement (at least in one direction) should be valid also for fields of characteristic p > 5. We have a minimal model program for threefolds over algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 5 (see [10]) and it should work also in relative situation with a group action over arbitrary perfect field, but it is not known to the author if it is written down -nywhere. To prove the converse statement we need an analog of the Noether–Fano inequalities in positive characteristic and the existence of such analog is also unknown to the author. Remark 3.7. It is still an open question: does the birational (super)rigidity of the variety Xk = X ⊗Spec k Spec k over the field k implies the birational (super)rigidity of the variety X over the field k and is the same assertion true for varieties with the group action (see discussion in [11] and especially [11, Question 4]). Such a result is valid for algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero and its algebraically closed extension K, see [11, Theorem 2, Theorem 6]. References [1] A.

      "1. Introduction Let k be a field with separable closure ks. A natural invariant of a finite group G is the minimal dimension of a faithful representation of G over k, known as the representation dimension rdimk (G) of G over k. In [KM08, Thm. 4.1], Karpenko and Merkurjev showed that rdimk (G) is equal to the essential dimension edk (G) when G is a finite p-group over a field k containing a p-th root of unity. Since then, much work has been done on the representation dimensions of finite p-groups, such as [MR10], [CKR11], and [BMKS16]. For finite groups more broadly, representation dimension is an upper bound on essential dimension, although the two do not coincide in general. It is natural to study bounds on the complexity of groups via bounds on their representation dimensions. In [CKR11], Cernele, Kamgarpour, and Reichstein proved upper bounds in terms of p and n on the representation dimensions over the complex numbers C of groups of order p n for prime p. Similarly, Moret´o showed that the representation dimension over C of any finite group G, except for certain 2-groups, is at most p |G| [Mor21]. While the works in the previous paragraph focused on complex representations of groups, in the current work we investigate representations of algebraic tori over arbitrary fields. An (algebraic) torus over k is an algebraic group over k that, when viewed as an algebraic group over ks, is isomorphic to a finite product of copies of the multiplicative group. We say that an algebraic torus over k is irreducible if it does not properly contain a subtorus over k. Every algebraic torus T admits a matrix representation 12 B. HEATH via an embedding T ֒→ GLn for some positive integer n, and the representation dimension rdim (T) is the minimal n for which there exists a faithful embedding T ֒→ GLn. A result analogous to that of [KM08, Thm. 4.1] for essential p-dimensions of tori over arbitrary fields was proved in [LMMR13], with minimal degrees of p-faithful representations of tori appearing in the result. Moreover, Merkurjev proved an explicit formula for the representation dimension of an algebraic torus over a field whose splitting group is a p-group [Mer17, Thm. 4.3]. A consequence of the Jordan-Zassenhaus Theorem below is the following: For any positive integer n, there exists a maximal representation dimension of all n-dimensional algebraic tori over all fields. In this paper, we study the following quantities, where each maximum is taken over all fields: rdim (n) := max {rdim (T) | T a torus, dim (T) = n} rdimirr (n) := max {rdim (T) | T an irreducible torus, dim (T) = n} . We now state the results of the present work. Theorem 1.1. In Table 1, we have lower bounds on rdim (n) for all positive integers n. Table 1. Lower bounds on rdim (n) for all positive integers n. n rdim (n) ≥ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ≥ 7 n Note that Theorem 1.1 only asserts the existence of some n-dimensional torus over some field with the claimed representation dimension, so the bounds are not guaranteed to hold over a given particular field. However, we show that these bounds hold over the following important class of fields. Corollary 1.2. The bounds on rdim (n) in Theorem 1.1 hold over any number field. We show that Table 1 gives exact values of rdimirr (n) in many cases. Theorem 1.3. The bounds in Table 1 give exact values of rdimirr (n) for the following values of n: (a) n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}. (b) primes n such that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo n is equal to n − 1 or n− .REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Item (b) in Theorem 1.3 addresses the specific cases a = 1, 2 of the following more general asymptotic bound; in particular, it says that we can take N1 = N2 = 1. Theorem 1.4. For all positive integers a, there exists a positive integer Na such that, for all primes p ≥ Na such that the multiplicative order of modulo p is equal to p− a , we have rdimirr (p) = 2p. Although a bound on Na in Theorem 1.4 can be extracted from the proof of Theorem 5.22, this is not enough to prove that Theorem 1.4 implies that rdimirr (p) = 2pfor infinitely many primes p. For example, this would follow from the existence of some positive integer a such that there exist infinitely primes p for which the order of 2 modulo p is equal to p− a , but no such a is known. In particular, Artin famously conjectured that there are infinitely many primes p such that 2 is a primitive root modulo p (i.e., the a = case) [HB86, §1], yet this remains an open problem. Nonetheless, based on the theorems above and computational evidence, we pose the following conjecture. Conjecture 1.5. The bounds in Table 1 give exact values of rdim (n) for all positive integers n.

Preliminaries The main tools that we use to study representation dimensions of algebraic tori are G-lattices and their symmetric ranks. This largely reduces to the study of actions of finite integral matrix groups on certain subgroups of the additive group Z n . Let us begin with the definition of a G-lattice. We write Z + for the set of positive integers. Definition 2.1. A lattice L is a free Z-module of finite rank n ∈ Z +. In this case, we say that the rank of L is rank (L) = n. If the group G acts on L (or, equivalently, if L is a module over the group ring Z [G]), then we further say that L is a G-lattice. Note that every G-lattice L can be written (up to isomorphism) with L = Z n and G a subgroup of GLn (Z), where n = rank (L). We will often think about G-lattices through this linear algebraic lens moving forward. We often focus on irreducible G-lattices in this paper.4 B. HEATH Definition 2.2. The G-lattice L is irreducible if the Q [G] module LQ := L ⊗Z Q is irreducible, i.e., if LQ has no nontrivial proper G-invariant submodules. Definition 2.3. The subgroup G ≤ GLn (Z) is said to be irreducible if the G-lattice Z n is irreducible. The G-lattices L and L ′ are said to be Z-equivalent if L ∼= L′ as Z [G]- modules, and L and L ′ are said to be Q-equivalent if LQ ∼= L ′ Q as Q [G]- modules. This distinction between isomorphism of G-lattices over Z and over Q is subtle, but important. We record the following useful observations about Q-equivalence of G-lattices. Proposition 2.4. [PP77a, §2] [Lor05, §1.2.1] Let G be a group and let L be a G-lattice of rank n. (a) If L ′ ⊆ L is a G-sublattice of rank n (or, equivalently, of finite index in L), then L and L ′ are Q-equivalent G-lattices. (b) Conversely, if LQ ∼= L ′ Q , then replacing L ′ with an isomorphic copy inside of LQ, we may assume that L ′ ⊆ L and that the quotient module L/L′is finite. The invariant of G-lattices that we use to study representation dimensions of algebraic tori is the symmetric rank. This notion was introduced by MacDonald in [Mac11], in which the author studied a related version of symmetric rank known as the symmetric p-rank in order to study essential p-dimensions of normalizers of maximal tori. Definition 2.5. The symmetric rank of a G-lattice L, denoted symrank (L, G), is the minimal size of a G-stable generating set of L. Lemma 2.6. Let n ∈ Z +, let G ≤ GLn (Z), and let L ⊆ Zn be a G-lattice. (a) We have the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ |G|rank (L). (b) If H ≤ GLn (Z) is conjugate over GLn (Z) to G, then there exists an H-lattice M ⊆ Z n such that M as an H-lattice is isomorphic to L as a G-lattice. In particular, symrank (M, H) = symrank (L, G). (c) If K ≤ G, then L is a K-lattice with symrank (L, K) ≤ symrank (L, G). Proof. For (a), let ℓ1, . . . , ℓrank(L) be a generating set for L as a lattice. Observe that the set S = Srank(L) i=1 Gℓi is a G-stable generating set for L, and |Gℓi| ≤ |G| for each 1 ≤ i ≤ rank (L). Thus, S is a G-stable generating set for L of size at most |G|rank (L). For (b), suppose G = AHA−1for A ∈ GLn (Z). The matrix A is a change of basis matrix from the standard basis for Z n to some other basis B for Z n , so take M to be the lattice L written in the basis B. For (c), it is clear that L is a K-lattice. The symmetric rank statement follows from the fact that the G-orbit of v ∈ L is equal to the union of the orbits of v under the actions of the cosets of K in G. REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Note that any two Z-equivalent G-lattices have the same symmetric rank by (b) of Lemma 2.6, but Q-equivalent G-lattices need not have equal symmetric ranks. Given an algebraic torus T, the character group XT of T is a G -lattice for the absolute Galois group G := Gal (ks/k) (see, e.g., [Wat79, §7.3]). Although G may be infinite, the following observation tells us that we can think of G as acting on XT via a finite group. Proposition 2.7. [Wat79, §7.3] Let T be an algebraic torus with character group XT . Then, the action of G on XT factors through the finite group Gal (k ′/k) for some finite Galois extension k ⊆ k′ . Recall that an action of G on a set X is said to be continuous if X is a union of G -orbits where each orbit factors through Gal (k ′/k) for some finite Galois extension k ⊆ k ′ . The following theorem now makes precise the close relationship between G-lattices and algebraic tori. Theorem 2.8. [Wat79, §7.3] The functor F, from the category of algebraic tori to the category of finitely generated free Abelian groups on which G acts continuously, defined by F (T) = XT is an antiequivalence of categories. In particular, in the correspondence of Theorem 2.8, irreducible tori correspond to irreducible G -lattices. We now state the connection between representation dimensions of algebraic tori and symmetric ranks of G-lattices. See [Hea24, §4.4] for a proof. Theorem 2.9. Let T be an algebraic torus over the field k, let XT be the character group of T, and let G be the absolute Galois group of k. Then, rdim (T) = symrank (XT , G ). A direct consequence of Theorem 2.9 and the fact that every finite group occurs (up to isomorphism) as the Galois group of some Galois field extension is the following. Corollary 2.10. For all n ∈ Z +, we have rdim (n) = max (symrank (L, G)), where the maximum is taken over all finite groups G and all G-lattices of rank n. Even more explicitly, we obtain the following. Corollary 2.11. For all n ∈ Z +, we have rdim (n) = max (symrank (Z n , G)), where the maximum is taken over one representative G from each Z-conjugacy class of maximal (with respect to inclusion) finite subgroups of GLn (Z). We similarly have the following for rdimirr (n).6 B. HEATH Proposition 2.12. For all n ∈ Z +, we have rdimirr (n) = max (symrank (Z n , G)), where the maximum is taken over one representative G from each GLn (Z)- conjugacy class of irreducible, maximal, finite subgroups of GLn (Z). This motivates the study of finite subgroups of GLn (Z). One of the most famous results on this subject is the following theorem. Theorem 2.13 (Jordan-Zassenhaus Theorem). [Rei70, Thm. 2.6] For all n ∈ Z +, there are a finite number of Z-conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of GLn (Z). An important consequence of the Jordan-Zassenhaus Theorem is that the quantities rdim (n) and rdimirr (n) are well-defined. 3. Root Systems and Weyl Groups Some of the most important examples of G-lattices come from root systems and their Weyl groups. In this section, we compute the symmetric ranks of all W-lattices when W is the Weyl group of an irreducible root system, yielding lower bounds on rdim (n). We will then show that these bounds are realized over any number field. Theorem 3.4, along with the overall ideas in this section, are very similar to work done by Lemire to obtain upper bounds on essential dimensions of certain linear algebraic groups [Lem04]. We will follow the notation and conventions of [Hum72, Ch. 3]. • Φ denotes an irreducible root system of rank n ∈ Z + in a Euclidean space E with inner product (·, ·). • W (Φ), or simply W, is the Weyl group of Φ. • Λr is the root lattice associated to Φ, with base {α1, . . . , αn}. • For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we write σi: E → E for the reflection fixing the hyperplane orthogonal to αi , i.e., the hyperplane {β ∈ E | (β, αi) = 0}. • Λ is the weight lattice associated to Φ, with base {λ1, . . . , λn} given as follows: For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we define λi ∈ E to be the unique vector satisfying 2(λi,αj ) (αj ,αj ) = δi,j for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n, where δi,j is the Kronecker delta. • We denote by Λ+i an intermediate lattice Λr ⊂ Λ +i ⊂ Λ, with both inclusions proper and Λ : Λ+i = i. In the case Φ = Dn with n ≥ 4 even, there are two intermediate lattices with index 2 in Λ, each containing λn−1 or λn but not both. We will denote these intermediate lattices by Λ+ i , with λi ∈ Λ + i for each i ∈ {n − 1, n}. Computing symmetric ranks of root lattices is quite straightforward. Proposition 3.1. [Mac11, §1] Let Φ be an irreducible root system with Weyl group W and root lattice Λr. Then, the symmetric rank symrank (Λr, W) is equal to the number of short roots in Φ.REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI The following standard facts help us compute symmetric ranks of other W-lattices. Proposition 3.2. [Hum72, §13.1] For all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, we have σi (λj ) = λj − δi,jαi. In particular, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the reflection σi fixes all of the λj 's except for λi. Lemma 3.3. For any v = Pn i=1 viλi ∈ Λ, the stabilizer of v in W is given by stabW (v) = hσi| vi = 0i ≤ W. Proof. By Proposition 3.2, we have hσi| vi = 0i ⊆ stabW (v). The reverse inclusion follows from [Car72, Lem. 1]. We now present the main result of this section. Theorem 3.4. Let Φ be an irreducible root system of rank n with base {α1, . . . , αn} and Weyl group W, let Λr be the root lattice, and let Λ be the weight lattice with basis {λ1, . . . , λn} as defined above. Then, we have the values in Table 2 for the symmetric ranks of all W-lattices for all choices of Φ and n. In particular, the orbit W v is a particular W-stable generating set of minimal size for the given v ∈ Λ. Proof. Let C be the Cartan matrix of Φ, as given in [Hum72, §11.4]. If det (C) = 1, then Λr = Λ and we are done by Proposition 3.1. Otherwise, we identify Λ with Z n by identifying each λi with the standard basis vector ei and proceed as follows. Using the Smith normal form, there exist P, Q ∈ GLn (Z) and an n × n integral diagonal matrix D such that P CQ = D. Note that the choices of P and Q are not canonical; our choices can be found in [Hea24, Appendix A]. As C is the change of basis matrix from the λi's to the αi's [Hum72, §13.1], we have v ∈ Λ is an element of Λr if and only if Cw = v for some w ∈ Z n . Since Q ∈ GLn (Z), this is equivalent to the existence of some u ∈ Z n such that CQu = P −1Du = v. This equation provides conditions (via a system of linear equations) for determining the smallest (with respect to inclusion) W-sublattice of Λ containing a given v ∈ Λ. For each choice of Φ and n, the matrix P −1D is given in Table 3. From there, it is a standard fact (see, e.g., [Hum72, Lemma 10.4.B]) that the W-orbit of any nonzero v ∈ Λ has full rank. Therefore, if L ⊆ Λ is the smallest W-sublattice of Λ containing v, then the lattice spanned by W v must be L. We then use Lemma 3.3 and information about the Weyl groups of root systems (see, e.g., [Hum72, §12.2]) to compute the sizes of these orbits. We now have the following immediate corollary of Theorem 3.4. Corollary 3.5. In Table 4, we have lower bounds on rdim (n) for all n ∈ Z +, along with a G-lattice realizing each bound.8 B.

Theorem 3.6. For any number field K and any n ∈ Z +, there exists an algebraic torus T over K of dimension n with rdim (T) equal to the bound given in Corollary 3.5. Proof. The key idea is the following result of [Nuz95]: For all irreducible root systems Φ except F4, there exists a regular Galois extension of the function field Q (t) (where t is an indeterminate) with Galois group isomorphic to the Weyl group W (Φ).

Now, let K be a number field and let W be the Weyl group of an irreducible root system besides F4. By [JLY02, Cor. 3.2.4], K is Hilbertian. Since W is realizable as a Galois group over Q (t) by the paragraph above, Proposition 3.3.6 of [JLY02] implies that W is realizable as a Galois group over K (t).

Irreducible G-Lattices of Rank n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23} Now, we compute rdimirr (n) for n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}. In particular, we will show that the lower bounds given in Corollary 3.5 are sharp by finding upper bounds on the symmetric ranks of all irreducible G-lattices in these dimensions. These dimensions are special because of Theorem 4.1 below. We use the common abbreviation i.m.f. for \"irreducible, maximal, finite.\" Theorem 4.1. [Vos65] [Tah71] [Dad65] [WBN71] [Ryˇs72] [PP77a] [PP77b] [PP80a] [PP80b] [PP80c] [Ple85] [Sou94] Explicit representatives of the Zconjugacy classes of i.m.f. subgroups of GLn (Z) are known for 1 ≤ n ≤ and n = 13, 17, 19, 23. Representatives from Theorem 4.1 are stored in the computer algebra system GAP [GAP22], along with other information about the groups. Each group is identified via an ordered triple (d, q, z), where d is the dimension, q is the numerical label of the GLn (Q)-class, and z is the numerical label of the GLn (Z)-class within the GLn (Q)-class. For more details, please see 50.7 of the online GAP manual. We have the following useful characterization of all i.m.f. subgroups of GLn (Z). Proposition 4.2. [PP77a, p. 536] For every i.m.f. subgroup G < GLn (Z), there exists a (not necessarily unique) positive definite n × n integral matrix X such that G is the full group of Z-automorphisms of X, i.e., G = AutZ (X) = M ∈ GLn (Z) | MT XM = X . Along with other data about the group, GAP stores such a matrix X for each i.m.f. subgroup. Definition 4.3. Given a positive definite n × n integral matrix X and a column vector v ∈ Z n , we call the integer v T Xv the norm of v under X.REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI The Θ-series of X is the power series ΘX (q) = P∞ i=0 Niq i with coefficients given by Ni:= v ∈ Z n | v T Xv = i . We now obtain a bound on symrank (Z n , G) in terms of the Θ-series coefficients. Lemma 4.4. Let G < GLn (Z) be an i.m.f. subgroup and suppose that G = AutZ (X) for the positive definite n × n integral matrix X. Write D = {Xi,i P | 1 ≤ i ≤ n} for the set of diagonal entries of X and ΘX (q) = ∞ i=0 Niq i for the Θ-series of X. Then, symrank (Z n , G) ≤ X i∈D Ni. Proof. Observe that the set v ∈ Z n | v T Xv ∈ D is G-stable and contains the standard basis vectors for Z n . Although the bound given in Lemma 4.4 is rather coarse in general, in most cases it is sufficient to prove the sharpness of the claimed bounds in dimensions 1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. Theorem 4.5. In Table 4.5, we have exact values of rdimirr (n), along with a G-lattice realizing each value. Table 5. Exact values of rdimirr (n) for dimensions n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}. n rdimirr (n) G-Lattice 1 2 (Λr, W (A1)) 2 6 (Λr, W (G2)) 3 12 (Λr, W (A3)) 4 24 (Λr, W (C4)) 5 40 (Λr, W (D5)) 6 72 (Λr, W (E6)) 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 n (Λ, W (Bn)) Proof. By Corollary 3.5, we need only to show that the values in Theorem 4.5 are upper bounds on rdimirr (n) for the given values of n. To do this, we use a computer algebra system to apply Lemma 4.4 to the representative from each GLn (Z)-conjugacy class of i.m.f. subgroups of GLn (Z) stored in GAP; see [Hea24, Appendix B] for our code and the output. We now address the groups for which Lemma 4.4 does not yield the claimed bound. The groups given by the following ordered triples are all isomorphic to C2×W (Dn), where C2 is the cyclic group of order 2: (d, 1, 3) for 5 ≤ d ≤ 10, (19, 1, 2), and (23, 2, 3). In each of these cases, by Theorem 3.4, we have symrank (Z n , G) ≤ 2 · n−1 = 2n .12 B. HEATH This leaves only the 23-dimensional group G given by the ordered triple (23, 3, 2) to consider. For this case, we first obtain that G = hM1, M2i for M1, M2 ∈ GL23 (Z). (See [Hea24, p. 62-63] for M1 and M2.) The minimal (nonzero) norm under the corresponding matrix X is 4, and there are vectors in Z 23 of norm 4 under X, one of which is the standard basis vector e2 ∈ Z 23. By computing the union of the orbits of e2 under the subgroups hM1i,hM2i, and hM1M2i, we see that the orbit Ge2 spans Z 23 as a lattice. As Ge2 is a subset of the set of elements of norm 4 under X, it follows that symrank Z 23, G ≤ 93150 < 23, as desired. Remark 4.6. For all dimensions 1 ≤ n ≤ 31, Q-class representatives of i.m.f. subgroups of GLn (Z) are known and stored in GAP. However, since Q-equivalent G-lattices can have different symmetric ranks, the techniques applied in this section cannot (at present) be directly applied to those dimensions not addressed in Theorem 4.5. 5. Irreducible G-Lattices of Prime Rank In this section and the next, we study irreducible G-lattices in prime dimensions to prove Theorem 1.4 and (b) of Theorem 1.3. Prime dimensions are especially nice because of the following fact. Proposition 5.1. [PP77a, §1] If ∆ : G → GLp (Z) is an irreducible representation of a finite group G of prime degree p, then ∆ is irreducible over Z if and only if ∆ is irreducible over C. In odd prime dimensions p, the following proposition classifies irreducible finite subgroups G < GLp (Z) by their maximal normal 2-subgroups. We first introduce the following notation for a finite subgroup G < GLn (Z): • G+ := G ∩ SLn (Z). • We denote by O2 (G) the maximal normal 2-subgroup of G. Proposition 5.2. [Ple85, Prop. II.2] Let p > 2 be a prime integer, let G < GLp (Z) be an irreducible finite group, and let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p. Then, one of the following occurs: (a) O2 (G+) is elementary abelian of order dℓ for some integer 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ p− d . In this case, G+ is conjugate under GLp (Q) to a group of integral monomial matrices (i.e., signed permutation matrices). Moreover, G+ contains an irreducible subgroup which is an extension of an elementary abelian 2-group of order d by a cyclic group of order p. (b) O2 (G+) = 1. In this case, G+ has a unique minimal normal subgroup N 6= 1 (possibly N = G+), and N is nonabelian simple, the centralizer CG+ (N) = 1, and N is irreducible as a matrix group. We will use Proposition 5.2 to consider two separate cases for irreducible finite subgroups of GLp (Z): Those satisfying (a), which we focus on in this section; and those satisfying (b), which we will address in Section 6.REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI We denote by Monn (Z) the group of all n × n monomial matrices and by Dn (Z) the subgroup of diagonal matrices. Note that Dn (Z) ∼= C n ; in particular, Monn (Z) ∼= Dn (Z) ⋊ Sn ∼= C n 2 ⋊ Sn, where C2 is the cyclic group of order 2 and Sn is the symmetric group on n letters. Unlike in those dimensions addressed in Chapter 4, in prime dimensions p ≥ 29 we have only a description of the GLp (Q)-conjugacy classes of irreducible, maximal, finite (i.m.f.) subgroups as opposed to the GLp (Z)- conjugacy classes. Thus, we use the following slightly different strategy in this section. Proposition 5.3. Let G < GLp (Z) be an irreducible finite group satisfying (a) of Proposition 5.2. Then, we have symrank (Z p , G) ≤ max H,L (symrank (L, H)), where the maximum is taken over all irreducible subgroups H ≤ Monp (Z) such that −Ip ∈ H and all H-lattices L ⊆ Z p . Proof. This follows from Proposition 2.4 and (a) of Proposition 5.2. Note that we may restrict our attention to those groups satisfying −Ip ∈ H because any group not satisfying this condition is certainly not a maximal subgroup of GLp (Z) up to Z-conjugacy. Observation 5.4. If −In ∈ G ≤ GLn (Z) for some odd n ∈ Z +, then: (a) G = −G. (b) |G| = 2 |G+|. (c) O2 (G) ∼= O2 (G+) × C2. Unless stated otherwise, throughout the remainder of this section, G ≤ Monn (Z) is an irreducible group satisfying the conditions that −In ∈ G, that |O2 (G+)| > 1, and that π (G) ≤ Sn contains an n-cycle (because of the final sentence in (a) of Proposition 5.2), where π : G → Sn is the projection map. We now classify the possibilities for O2 (G). First, we make an observation about 2-subgroups of Sn for odd n > 2. Lemma 5.5. If σ ∈ Sn is an n-cycle for n ≥ 3 odd, then the action of conjugation by σ on the set of 2-subgroups of Sn has no nontrivial fixed points. Proof. By [Cov00, Thm. 4.2.3], we have the following description of the Sylow-2 subgroups of Sn: Writing n in its base-2 representation n = Ps i=0 ai i (each ai ∈ {0, 1} and as = 1), the Sylow 2-subgroups of Sn are isomorphic to the direct products of the Sylow 2-subgroups of S i for 0 ≤ i ≤ s with ai = 1. Since n is odd, any nontrivial 2-subgroup S ≤ Sn therefore leaves fixed some 1 ≤ j ≤ n, but some element of σSσ−1 moves j since σ contains an n-cycle. Thus, σSσ−1 6= S. 14 B. HEATH Lemma 5.6. Let n > 2 be odd and let G ≤ Monn (Z) be a group of monomial matrices such that π (G) contains an n-cycle. Then, O2 (G) ≤ Dn (Z) (or, equivalently, O2 (G) = G ∩ Dn (Z)) and G ∼= O2 (G) ⋊ π (G). Proof. We prove that O2 (G) ≤ Dn (Z); the subsequent statement then follows. View G as a subgroup of Dn (Z) ⋊ Sn, and observe that π (O2 (G)) E π (G) is a normal 2-subgroup. Since π (G) contains an n-cycle, Lemma 5. implies that π (O2 (G)) must be trivial. We now have the following corollary of Lemma 5.6. Notationally, for a prime power q, we write Fq for the field with q elements. When q is prime, we take Fq to be the set {0, 1, . . . , q − 1} under the operations of addition and multiplication modulo q Corollary 5.7. Under the conditions of Lemma 5.6, O2 (G) must correspond to a π (G)-stable subspace of C p ∼= F p , where π (G) ≤ Sp acts by shuffling coordinates. For σ ∈ π (G), we will write Mσ for the permutation matrix in GLn (Z) corresponding to σ. At the level of matrices, the explicit action of π (G) on O2 (G) = G ∩ Dp (Z) is as follows: For D ∈ O2 (G), the permutation σ ∈ π (G) acts on D via D 7→ MσDM− σ . This has the effect of taking the (i, i) entry in D to position (σ (i), σ (i)). Corollary 5.7 motivates the study of subspaces of F p that are stable under certain subgroups of Sp. In particular, as the cyclic group Cp ≤ π (G) by assumption, the set of π (G)-stable subspaces of F p is a subset of the set of Cp-stable subspaces of F p . We will write k for the algebraic closure of the field k. Lemma 5.8. Let p > 2 be prime, let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p, let ζp ∈ F2 be a primitive pth root of unity, and let t1, . . . , t(p−1)/d ⊆ F × p be a transversal for the orbit of 2. Then, in the polynomial ring F2 [x], the polynomial x p − 1 factors into irreducibles as xp − 1 = Q(p−1)/d i=0 fi , where f0 (x) := x − 1 and fi (x) := Qd− j= x − ζ j ti p for all 1 ≤ i ≤ p− d . Proof. This follows from the standard fact that the Frobenius map y 7→ y generates any finite subgroup of the Galois group Gal F2/F (see, e.g., [DF04, §14.9]). Lemma 5.9. Let p > 2 be prime, let Cp act on F p by shuffling coordinates, and let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p. Then, there are p− d + 1 irreducible Cp-stable subspaces of F p , one corresponding to each of the irreducible factors of x p − 1 in the polynomial ring F2 [x]. Proof. Observe that Cp-stable subspaces of F p correspond to ideals in the quotient ring R := F2 [x] / (x p − 1). Lemma 5.8 and the Chinese RemainderREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Theorem give the following decomposition of R: (5.1) R ∼= (p M−1)/d i= F2 [x] / (fi) ∼= F2 ⊕ (p M−1)/d i= F d , where the fi are the irreducible polynomials defined in Lemma 5.8. We thus obtain a bijective correspondence between subsets of n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o and Cp-stable subspaces of F p . From here, we can explicitly construct the possibilities for O2 (G). Corollary 5.10. Let p > 2 be prime, let G < Monp (Z) be an irreducible group, and let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p. Write F2 = {0, 1} and x p−1 = Q(p−1)/d i=0 fi in F2 [x], with the fi's as defined in Lemma 5.8. For 0 ≤ i ≤ p− d , define gi:= Q j6=i fj ∈ F2 [x] and define the diagonal matrix Di ∈ Dp (Z) via Dij,j := ( 1 if the x j− coefficient of giis −1 if the x j− coefficient of giis 1. Then, for some S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o , we have O2 (G) = MσDiM− σ | σ ∈ π (G), i ∈ S ≤ Dp (Z), where Mσ ∈ GLp (Z) is the permutation matrix corresponding to the permutation σ ∈ π (G). Proof. By Corollary 5.7, O2 (G) must correspond to a π (G)-stable subspace of F p ; in particular, this subspace must be Cp-stable, so it must preserve the irreducible summands in (5.1). To identify a representative gifor the irreducible component F2 [x] / (fi), we seek a polynomial in F2 [x] satisfying gi ≡ 0 (mod fj ) for j 6= i and satisfying gi 6≡ 0 (mod fi). The gi given in the statement satisfies these conditions. In Table 6, we illustrate the ideas of Lemma 5.9 and Corollary 5.10 in four key cases. We define the all 1's column vector 1 · · · T =: 1. By abuse of notation, we will use the same notation whether viewing 1 as an element of F n or Z n , with the context making the meaning clear. Further, we write V1 := {1, 0} ⊆ F n and L1 ⊆ Z n for the G-lattice generated by 1 ∈ Z n . Definition 5.11. The support of a vector v = v1 · · · vn T in F n or Z n is the set supp (v) = i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} vi 6= . The support length of v is the quantity |supp (v)|.16 B. HEATH Table 6. Key examples of the correspondence between subsets of n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o , subspaces of F p , and representations of O2 (G) ≤ Dp (Z) described in Lemma 5.9 and Corollary 5.10. S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o Subspace of F p 2 O2 (G) ≤ Dp (Z) ∅ 0 {0} V1 = {1, 0} {±Ip} n 1, 2, . . . , p− d o VE := v ∈ F p |supp (v)| even Dp (Z) ∩ SLp (Z) n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o F p 2 Dp (Z) The following proposition gives a useful description of the subspaces in Table 6. We write An for the alternating group on n letters. Proposition 5.12. For all n ≥ 3, the only An-stable subspaces of F n are 0, F n , V1 = {1, 0}, and VE := v ∈ F n |supp (v)| even . These four subspaces are also the only Sn-stable subspaces of F n for all n ≥ 3. Proof. We first show that the four claimed subspaces are Sn-stable subspaces. It is clear that 0, V1, and F n are Sn-stable subspaces, and it is clear that the set VE is Sn-stable. That VE is a subspace of F n is a consequence of the following observation for v, w ∈ F n : |supp (v + w)| = |supp (v)| + |supp (w)| − 2 |supp (v) ∩ supp (w)| . Now, we show that these four subspaces are the only An-stable subspaces of F n ; it will then immediately follow that they are the only Sn-stable subspaces as well. We first observe that any An-stable subspace of F n containing one of the standard basis vectors must be all of F n and that any An-stable subspace containing a vector with support length 2 must contain VE. Further, since [F n : VE] = 2, it follows that VE is a maximal proper subspace of F n , so any subspace of F n containing VE must be VE or F n . Let v = v1 · · · vn T ∈ F n \\ {0, 1} and consider the An-subspace hAnvi ⊆ F n generated by v. If |supp (v)| ∈ {1, 2}, then hAnvi ∈ {F n , VE} by the previous paragraph and we are done. Similarly, if n = 3, then everyREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI vector in F n is either 0, 1, or has support length 1 or 2, and we are done by the previous paragraph. If n ≥ 4 and |supp (v)| ≥ 3, then there exist distinct 1 ≤ i, j, k, ℓ ≤ n such that vi = vj = vk = 1 and vℓ = 0. Let σ = (i, j) (k, ℓ) ∈ An and observe that |supp (v + σv)| = 2. It follows that hAnvi contains VE, so we are done. The following special class of integral vectors will be very important moving forward. Definition 5.13. We call a vector v ∈ Z n whose entries all belong to the set {0, 1} a binary vector of Z n . As the following result shows, binary vectors can be used to cook up nice generating sets for G-lattices when G is a group of monomial matrices containing all diagonal matrices in GLn (Z). We call a lattice L ⊆ Z n primitive if L 6= mM for any lattice M ⊆ Z n and integer m ≥ 2. Lemma 5.14. Let n ∈ Z +, let Dn (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monn (Z) such that π (G) ≤ Sn contains an n-cycle, and let L ⊆ Z n be a primitive G-lattice. (a) L is generated by binary vectors in Z n . (b) If L /∈ {0, L1} is a G-sublattice of Z n , then L contains a binary vector v ∈ Z n such that |supp (v)| ≤ 2n , where ⌊·⌋ is the floor function. Proof. The claim is trivially satisfied for n = 1, so we assume that n ≥ 2. To prove (a), it suffices to show that 2Z n ⊆ L. Since G contains a permutation matrix of degree n, this further reduces to showing that 2ei ∈ L for some 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where the ei's are the standard basis vectors for Z n . By the primitivity of L, there exists v = v1 · · · vn T ∈ L such that vj = 1 for some 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The diagonal matrix D with Djj = 1 and Dii = −1 for all i 6= j is an element of G, so v + Dv = 2ej ∈ L. Now, assume that L /∈ {0, L1} and that (b) does not hold. By (a), L contains distinct binary vectors v, w with support length at least 2n . Then, every entry of v + w is a 0, 1, or 2, with at least n of the entries being 2's. The 2's can be eliminated by subtracting 2ei, all of which are in L by the proof of (a), for appropriate choices of i, yielding a binary vector in L with support length at most 2n . Our next goal is to understand the primitive G-sublattices of Z p for groups G satisfying the conditions of Lemma 5.14. This turns out to be extremely similar to our above discussion of the possible representations of O2 (G). Corollary 5.15. Let p > 2 be prime, let Dp (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monp (Z) such that π (G) ≤ Sp contains a p-cycle, and let d be the multiplicative order of modulo p. Write F2 = {0, 1} and x p − 1 = Q(p−1)/d i=0 fi in F2 [x], with the fi's as defined in Lemma 5.8, and let g0, . . . , gn be as defined in Corollary 5.10. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, define the binary column vector vi ∈ Z p by defining vij to be the x j− coefficient of gi (viewing the entries of vi as elements of Z18 B. HEATH Table 7. Key examples of the correspondence between subsets of n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o and G-sublattices of Z p for finite groups Dp (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monp (Z) that contain a p-cycle. The vector 1 ∈ Z p is the all 1's vector, and L1 is the G-sublattice of Z p generated by the G-orbit of 1. See Table 6 or Proposition 5.12 for the definition of VE. S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o Subspace of F p 2 G-sublattice of Z p ∅ 0 {0} V1 = {1, 0} L n 1, 2, . . . , p− d o VE LE := [vi] ∈ Z p 2 | Pp i=1 vi n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o F p 2 Z p rather than of F2). Write Lifor the G-lattice generated by vi. Then, every primitive G-sublattice L ⊆ Z p has the form L = X i∈S Li for some S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o . Proof. This is analogous to Corollary 5.10, along with Lemma 5.14. In Table 7, we explicitly give the correspondence described in Corollary 5.15 in the same four cases as Table 6. Corollary 5.16. Suppose Dp (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monp (Z) satisfies the condition that π (G) ≤ Sp contains a p-cycle, and let L /∈ {0, L1} be a primitive Gsublattice of Z p . Then, L is generated as a G-lattice by the G-orbits of at most p− d binary vectors in Z p , each with support length at most j 2p k . Proof. If the subset S ⊆ n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o corresponding to L in Corollary 5.15 is S = n 0, 1, . . . , p− d o , then L = Z p , which is generated by the G-orbit of any of the standard basis vectors of Z p . Otherwise, |S| ≤ p− d . For any 0 ≤ i ≤ p− d , the G-lattice Li (as in Corollary 5.15) is generated by the G-orbit of any of its nonzero binary elements, as the corresponding idealREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI in F2 [x] / (x p − 1) (see (5.1)) is a field. The support length condition then follows from (b) of Lemma 5.14. We can bound the orbit size of a binary vector under a subgroup of Monn (Z) as a function of its support length and |π (G)|. Lemma 5.17. Let n ∈ Z +, let Dn (Z) ≤ G ≤ Monn (Z), and let π : G → Sn be the projection map. Then, for any binary vector v ∈ Z n , we have |Gv| ≤ |supp(v)| |π (G) v| ≤ |supp(v)| |π (G)|. Proof. The number of ways to permute the nonzero entries of v using elements of G is at most |π (G)|. Since Dn (Z) ≤ G, the number of ways to negate the nonzero entries in v using elements of G is 2|supp(v)|. We are now ready to prove symmetric rank bounds. Proposition 5.18. Let p ≥ 7 be a prime number and let G ≤ Monp (Z) be an irreducible group of monomial matrices satisfying −Ip ∈ G and |O2 (G+)| > 1, and let π : G → Sp be the projection map. If the only π (G)-stable subspaces of F p are those in Proposition 5.12, then for any G-lattice L ⊆ Z p , we have symrank (L, G) ≤ p . Proof. First, we show that O2 (G) = Dp (Z). By Corollary 5.7, we know that O2 (G) must correspond to a π (G)-stable subspace of F p . Given our assumptions on these subspaces, the only possibilities for O2 (G) are those in Table 6. Out of these, the only possibilities satisfying the conditions −Ip ∈ G and |O2 (G+)| > 1 is Dp (Z). We may then apply (a) of Lemma 5.14, and Table 7 shows that the only possible nontrivial G-sublattices of Z p are Zp , LE, and L1. Thus, it suffices to find an element v of each of these G-lattices whose Monp (Z)-orbit spans the lattice and satisfies |Monp (Z) v| ≤ p , as |Gv| ≤ |Monp (Z) v|. For Z p , we may choose v to be any standard basis vector ei of Z p , in which case we have |Monp (Z) v| = 2p. For LE, we may choose any v = ei + ej for distinct standard basis vectors ei, ej ∈ Z p , in which case we have |Monp (Z) v| = p · 2 = 2p (p − 1) < 2p (as p ≥ 7). For L1, we choose v = 1, which satisfies |Monp (Z) v| = 2p. Proposition 5.18 now immediately gives the following result, which applies to conjecturally infinitely many primes by Artin's Conjecture on primitive roots [HB86, §1]. Corollary 5.19. Suppose p ≥ 7 is a prime such that 2 is a primitive root modulo p, and suppose G < GLp (Z) is an irreducible finite group satisfying (a) of Proposition 5.2. Then, for any G-lattice L ⊆ Z p , we have symrank (L, G) ≤ p . Proof. Since the multiplicative order of 2 in F × p is d = p − 1, by Lemma 5. the only possible Cp-stable subspaces (and, thus, the only possible π (G)- stable subspaces) of F p are the four listed in Proposition 5.12. 20 B. HEATH For more general prime dimensions p, we consider the various possibilities for π (G) ≤ Sp. Since π (G) contains a p-cycle by assumption, we know that π (G) is a transitive permutation group of prime degree, which turns out to be quite restrictive. Theorem 5.20. [Bur00, p. 177] [Cam99, §7.3, §7.4] If P ≤ Sp is a transitive permutation group of prime degree p, then P satisfies one of the following. (a) P is the symmetric group Sp. (b) P is the alternating group Ap. (c) P is a metacyclic group of order dividing p (p − 1). (d) There exist a prime power q = u t and m ∈ Z+, with (m, q) ∈/ {(2, 2),(2, 3)}, such that p = qm− q− and the socle of P is isomorphic to the m-dimensional projective special linear group PSLm (q) over the finite field with q elements. In this case, |P| ≤ |PSLm (q)| gcd (m, q − 1)t. Because of (d) in Theorem 5.20, the following formula will be useful. Proposition 5.21. [Wil09, §3.3.1] For all m ≥ 2 and prime powers q, we have |PSLm (q)| = q m(m−1)/ gcd (m, q − 1) Ym i= q i − . We now prove an asymptotic result about symmetric ranks in prime dimensions. Theorem 5.22. For all a ∈ Z +, there exists Na ∈ Z+ such that, for all primes p ≥ Na for which the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is equal to p− a and all irreducible finite subgroups G < GLp (Z) satisfying (a) of Proposition 5.2, we have symrank (Z p , G) ≤ p . Proof. Fix a ∈ Z +, and suppose that p ∈ Z+ is a prime such that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is equal to d = p− a . By (a) of Proposition 5.2 and Proposition 5.3, it suffices to consider G ≤ Monp (Z) satisfying −Ip ∈ G and O + (G) > 1, and primitive G-sublattices L ⊆ Z p . By (c) of Observation 5.4 and (a) of Proposition 5.2, we have O2 (G) ∼= C dℓ+ ∼= C ℓ(p−1)/a+ for some integer 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ a. By Lemma 5.6, we have G ∼= O2 (G) ⋊ π (G), where π : G → Sp is the projection map. Since π (G) contains a p-cycle by (a) of Proposition 5.2, we may proceed by considering the possibilities for π (G) given by Theorem 5.20. Case I: If π (G) ∈ {Ap, Sp}, then we are done by Propositions 5.12 and 5.18. Case II: Assume that π (G) is a metacyclic group of order dividing p (p − 1). We then have |π (G)| ≤ p (p − 1), so |G| ≤ ℓ(p−1)/a+1p (p − 1).REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Subcase i: Suppose 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ a − 1. Then, (a) of Lemma 2.6 gives the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ |G| p ≤ ℓ(p−1)/a+1p (p − 1) ≤ (a−1)(p−1)/a+1p (p − 1). Thus, it suffices to show that 2pis greater than or equal to the rightmost expression. This is equivalent to verifying the inequality (p−1)/a ≥ p (p − 1). Since a is fixed, this inequality is satisfied for sufficiently large p. Subcase ii: Suppose ℓ = a. Then, we have O2 (G) ∼= C p , so Dp (Z) ≤ G. Thus, we apply (a) of Lemma 2.6, Corollary 5.16, and Lemma 5.17 to attain the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ a · ⌊2p/3⌋ p (p − 1). Similar to subcase (i), it suffices to verify that p/3 ≥ ap (p − 1), which holds for sufficiently large p since a is fixed. Case III: Assume that π (G) satisfies (d) of Theorem 5.20; in particular, suppose the socle of G is isomorphic to PSLm (q), where q = u t for some prime u and t ∈ Z +. Note that we have p = qm− q− in this case. Observe that 2 ≤ q ≤ p and that m = logq[p (q − 1) + 1]. We proceed by considering the same two subcases as in case II. Subcase i: Suppose 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ a − 1. In this case, we have |G| ≤ ℓ(p−1)/a+ · q m(m−1)/ gcd (m, q − 1) · Ym i= q i − · t · gcd (m, q − 1). Using some algebra, (a) of Lemma 2.6, and the fact that ℓ ≤ a − 1, we see that it suffices to verify the following inequality: (5.2) 2 p− a ≥ q m(m−1)/ · Ym i= q i − · t · p. To this end, observe that Ym i= q i − < Ym i= q i = q Pm i=2 i = q m(m+1)/2− . In particular, q m(m−1)/ q m(m+1)/2−1 = qm2− . Since 2 ≤ q ≤ p, we have m = logq[p (q − 1) + 1] ≤ logq p 2 + ≤ log p 2 + . Therefore, q m2−1 < qm ≤ q logq(p 2+1)·log2(p2+1) = p 2 + 1log2(p 2+1) .22 B. HEATH Further, since the prime u must be at least 2, we have t = logu(q) ≤ log2(q) ≤ log2(p). Thus, we obtain the following inequality which is stronger than inequality (5.2): p− a ≥ p 2 + 1log2(p 2+1) · log2(p) · p. Since a is fixed, this inequality holds for sufficiently large p, as desired. Subcase ii: Suppose ℓ = a. In this case, we have O2 (G) = Dp (Z). Thus, we apply Corollary 5.16 and Lemma 5.17 to attain the following bound: symrank (L, G) ≤ p − d · ⌊2p/3⌋ · |π (G)| ≤ a · ⌊2p/3⌋ · q m(m−1)/ gcd (m, q − 1) · Ym i= q i − · gcd (m, q − 1) · t = a · ⌊2p/3⌋ · q m(m−1)/2 Ym i= q i − · t. Applying the bounds derived in subcase (i) and removing the floor from the exponent of the 2, it suffices to verify the following inequality: p/3 ≥ a · p 2 + 1log2(p 2+1) · log2(p). Since a is fixed, this inequality holds for all sufficiently large p, completing the proof. In particular, Corollary 5.19 asserts that when a = 1, we can take N1 = 2; in other words, symrankirr (p) ≤ p for all primes p for which the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is p − 1. We now show the same result in the a = case. Theorem 5.23. If p ≥ 7 is a prime number such that the order of 2 modulo p is p− , and G < GLp (Z) is an irreducible finite subgroup satisfying (a) of Proposition 5.2, then symrank (Z p , G) ≤ p . Proof. We follow the proof of Theorem 5.22, with a = 2. In particular, we must have ℓ ∈ {1, 2}. Note that the case p ≤ 23 is addressed in Chapter 4, so it suffices to prove the claim for primes p ≥ 41. The justification given for case I of Theorem 5.22 applies here as well, so we proceed to case II. Case II: Assume that π (G) is a metacyclic group of order dividing p (p − 1). As above, we have |G| ≤ ℓ(p−1)/2+1p (p − 1). Subcase i: If ℓ = 1, then (a) of Lemma 2.6 gives the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ |G| p = 2(p−1)/2+1p (p − 1), and the right hand side is less than or equal to 2pfor p ≥ 31 (verified using a computer algebra system).REPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI Subcase ii: If ℓ = 2, then Dp (Z) ≤ G, so we apply (a) of Lemma 2.6, Corollary 5.16, and Lemma 5.17 to attain the bound symrank (L, G) ≤ 2 · ⌊2p/3⌋ p (p − 1). The right hand side is less than or equal to 2pfor all p ≥ 31 (verified using a computer algebra system). Case III: Assume that π (G) satisfies (d) of Theorem 5.20; in particular, suppose the socle of G is isomorphic to PSLm (q), where q = u t for some prime u and t ∈ Z +. Note that we have p = qm− q− in this case. By [BS62, Table II], the first prime p of this form that is at least 41 and satisfies the condition that d = p− is the prime p = 2801, obtained by q = 7 and m = 5. Following the ideas in case III of the proof of Theorem 5.22, we find that p ≥ symrank (L, G) for p ≥ 760 when ℓ = 1 and for p ≥ 1297 when ℓ = 2. As 760 < 1297 < 2801, this completes the proof. 6. Almost Simple Groups in Prime Dimensions Let p ≥ 3 be a prime. Recall that (b) of Proposition 5.2 says the following about an irreducible finite matrix group G < GLp (Z): The group O2 (G+) = 1; the group G+ has a unique minimal normal subgroup N 6= 1 (possibly N = G+); the group N is nonabelian simple; the centralizer CG+ (N) = 1; and N is irreducible as a matrix group. In this section, we prove the following theorem. Theorem 6.1. Let p ≥ 7 be a prime number and let G < GLp (Z) be an irreducible finite group satisfying (b) of Proposition 5.2. Then, for any Glattice L ⊆ Z p , we have symrank (L, G) ≤ p . Theorem 4.5 implies Theorem 6.1 for p ∈ {7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23}, so it suffices to consider p ≥ 29 in this section. Further, observe that, together with Theorem 4.5, Corollary 5.19, and Theorems 5.22 and 5.23, Theorem 6.1 completes the proof of Theorems 1.4 and 1.3. In fact, Theorem 6.1 gives us something stronger, as this theorem does not have any restrictions on the order of 2 modulo p. Throughout this section, we let G < GLp (Z) be an irreducible finite group for some prime p ≥ 29. We assume that G+ satisfies (b) of Proposition 5.2; in particular, we have S E G+ ≤ Aut (S) for some nonabelian finite simple group S, so G+ is an almost simple group. We will follow notation from [CCN+85] for the finite simple groups. For an abstract group S, we write rdim (S) for the minimal degree of a faithful representation of S. It will be useful to have bounds on rdim (S) when S is a finite simple group. In many cases, bounds on the degrees of projective representations of finite simple groups are more accessible. To that end, recall that a projective representation of a group G is an injective group homomorphism G ֒→ PGLn (k) for some n ∈ Z + and some field k, where PGLn (k) is the n-dimensional projective general linear group over k. We now define the following analogue of representation dimension.24 B. HEATH Definition 6.2. We define the projective representation dimension of a group G, denoted prdim (G), to be the minimal n ∈ Z + for which G admits a projective representation G ֒→ PGLn (k) for some field k. Lemma 6.3. For all finite simple groups S, we have prdim (S) ≤ rdim (S). Proof. Suppose ρ : S ֒→ GLn (k) is a representation for some n ∈ Z + and some field k, and consider the quotient map φ : GLn (k) → PGLn (k). Since S is simple, it follows that the restriction of φ to ρ (S) is injective. Thus, the map φ ◦ ρ is a faithful projective representation of S of the same degree as ρ. Our goal is now to apply (a) of Lemma 2.6 to develop a bound on symrank (L, G) that is dependent only upon S. We start with a general numerical observation. Lemma 6.4. For all a, b, c ∈ Z +, if b ≥ a and 2a ≥ ac, then 2b ≥ bc. Proof. Since 2a ≥ ac ≥ c and 2b−a − 1 ≥ b − a, we have b − 2a = 2a b−a − ≥ c (b − a) = bc − ac, and the claim follows. Lemma 6.5. Suppose S E G+ ≤ Aut (S) for some nonabelian finite simple group S and irreducible finite matrix group G < GLp (Z) for p ≥ 29 prime. If S satisfies any of the following inequalities, then symrank (L, G) ≤ p for all G-lattices L ⊆ Z p . (6.1) 2rdim(S) ≥ 2 |Aut (S)|rdim (S) (6.2) 2prdim(S) ≥ 2 |Aut (S)| prdim (S) (6.3) 229 ≥ 58 |Aut (S)| Proof. The first inequality follows from (a) of Lemma 2.6, Lemma 6.4, and the observations that rdim (S) ≤ rdim (G) and |G| = G + ≤ 2 |Aut (S)| . The second inequality follows from the first inequality and Lemmas 6.4 and 6.3. The third inequality follows from the first inequality, Lemma 6.4, and Theorem 4.5. We now prove Theorem 6.1. Proof of Theorem 6.1. We consider three cases: when S is the alternating group An for some n ≥ 5, when S is a member of another infinite family of finite simple groups, and when S is one of the sporadic finite simple groups (although the methodologies in the second and third cases are essentially the same). Case I: Suppose that S ∼= An for some n ≥ 5. By [JK84, Thm. 2.5.7], all irreducible rational representations of An are restrictions of irreducibleREPRESENTATION DIMENSIONS OF ALGEBRAIC TORI rational representations of the full symmetric group Sn. Thus, by (c) of Lemma 2.6, it suffices to consider the case G+ ∼= Sn. By Theorem 2.3. of [JK84], the degree of an irreducible representation of Sn divides n!, and Theorem 3.4.10.ii of the same text states that the minimal degree of a faithful irreducible representation of Sn is equal to n−1. Furthermore, Theorem 3.4.10.iii of [JK84] says that for n ≥ 6, there does not exist a faithful irreducible representation of Sn of degree n. It now follows that the only possible prime degree of an irreducible representation of Sn is n − 1. The Weyl group W = W (An−1) ∼= Sn, so all G+-lattices (and, thus, all G-lattices) of rank n − 1 are W-lattices of the same rank. Therefore, since |G| = 2 |G+|, the desired bound now follows from Theorem 3.4. Case II: Suppose S is a member of one of the infinite families of finite simple groups aside from the alternating groups. We first apply Lemma 6. to each of the infinite families of finite simple groups to verify Theorem 6. for all but finitely many cases; see Table 8 for details. In each case, the strategy is to verify one of the inequalities in Lemma 6.5 for some value(s) of m and/or q, and then prove that as m and/or q increase the appropriate inequality still holds. For the remaining cases, we use [CCN+85] and a computer algebra system to find the minimal possible prime p such that a faithful representation of a group G satisfying S E G ≤ Aut (S) exists. By Lemma 6.4, it suffices to verify the inequality 2p ≥ 2 |Aut (S)| p in these cases. This is shown in Table 9. After using this approach, there are no more cases to consider. Case III: Assume that S is one of the 26 sporadic finite simple groups. We begin by applying Lemma 6.5 to each group, getting group information from [CCN+85]. This strategy proves the theorem for all but the following six groups: M23, M24, Co3, Co2, HS, and Mc L. For none of these six groups does there exist a potential S E G ≤ Aut (S) such that G admits an irreducible representation in prime degree p ≥ 29, so we are done. 26 B. HEATH Table 8.

We follow notation from [CCN+85] for our groups in the first column. In the second column, a \"p\" indicates that a lower bound on prdim (S) was used and an \"r\" indicates that a lower bound on rdim (S) was used; we also provide a citation for the bound.

      "2. For a typical U, Lemmas III.3 and IV.1 together imply that X j> λ j = O |A| . (30) Thus, aside from λ1, the eigenvalues λj must be quite small. A typical eigenvalue distribution is plotted in Figure 1. If we define λ˜ j = λj/(1 − λ1), then P j>1 λ˜ j = 1 and H1(λ˜) ≥ H2(λ˜) = − lnX j> λ˜ j = 2 ln |A| − O(1). (31) An application of the grouping property then gives us a good lower bound on the von Neumann entropy: H (N ⊗ N¯ )(Φ)= H1(λ) = h(λ1) + (1 − λ1)H1(λ˜) = 2 ln |A| − O(1), (32) 0 100 200 300 400 500 10− 10− 10− 10− 10− Spectrum of the output density operator Eigenvalue index Eigenvalue FIG. 1: Typical eigenvalue spectrum of (N ⊗ N¯ )(Φ) when |R| = 3 and |A| = |B| = 24. The eigenvalues are plotted in increasing order from left to right. The green dashed line corresponds to |S|/(|A||B|) = 1/3, which is essentially equal to the largest eigenvalue. The red solid line represents the value (1− |S| |A||B| )/|A| 2 = 1/864. If the density operator were maximally mixed aside from its largest eigenvalue, all but that one eigenvalue would fall on this line. While that is not the case here or in general, the remaining eigenvalues are nonetheless sufficiently small to ensure that the density operator has high von Neumann entropy. where h is the binary entropy function. This entropy is nearly as large as it can be and, in particular, as large as Hmin(N ) + Hmin(N¯ ) according to Theorem IV.1 of [50], the von Neumann entropy version of Lemma III.2. V. DISCUSSION The counterexamples presented here demonstrate that the maximal p-norm multiplicativity conjecture and, equivalently, the minimum output p-R´enyi entropy conjecture are false for all 1 < p ≤ ∞. The primary motivation for studying this conjecture was that it is a natural strengthening of the minimum (von Neumann) output entropy conjecture, which is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory. In particular, since the multiplicativity conjecture was formulated, most attempts to prove the minimum output entropy conjecture for special cases actually proved maximal p-norm multiplicativity and then took the limit as p decreases to 1. This strategy, we now know, cannot be used to prove the conjecture in general. From that perspective, it would seem that the results in this paper cast doubt on the validity of the minimum output entropy conjecture itself. However, as we have shown, the examples explored here appear to be completely consistent with the conjecture, precisely because the von Neumann entropy is more difficult to perturb than the R´enyi entropies of order p > 1. It is therefore still possible that the p = 1 conjecture could be demonstrated using subtle variants of p-norm multiplicativity such as exact or approximate multiplicativity in a channel-dependent interval (1, 1 + δ). Another strategy that is still open would be to approach the von Neumann minimum output entropy via R´enyi entropies for p < 1. It is possible that additivity holds there even as it fails for p > 1. That is not, unfortunately, a very well-informed speculation. With few exceptions [57], there has been very little research on the additivity question in the regime p < 1, even though many arguments can be easily adapted to this parameter region. (Eq. (13), for example, holds for all 0 < p.) Unfortunately, since the time the examples presented here were first circulated, counterexamples for p close to 0 were also discovered [58], casting doubt on the conjecture for the whole set of R´enyi entropies with p < 1. Indeed, as in the current paper, those examples are based on influencing a single eigenvalue of the output state of the tensor product channel; while here we increase the largest one, there the smallest is suppressed. Thus, while it seems doubtful that the examples of channels presented here will have direct implications for the addivity of the minimum von Neumann entropy, we think that they are still very useful as a new class of test cases. Indeed, as we remarked earlier, our examples eliminate what had been the previously favoured route to the conjecture via the output p-norms. As a final comment, while this paper has demonstrated that the maximal p-norm additivity conjecture fails for p > 1, all the counterexamples presented here have been nonconstructive. For the examples based on ǫ-randomizing maps, all the known explicit constructions (by Ambainis and Smith [59] or via iterated quantum expander maps [60, 61]) only give bounds in the 2-norm, which do imply bounds on the output p-norm but those are too weak to yield counterexamples to multiplicativity. Likewise, the counterexamples based on generic quantum channels rely on the existence of large subspaces containing only highly entangled states. Even when the entanglement is quantified using von Neumann entropy, in which case the existence of these subspaces was demonstrated in 2003 [50], not a single explicit construction is known. The culprit, as in many other related contexts [62], is our use of the probabilistic method. Since we don't have any explicit counterexamples, only a proof that counterexamples exist, it remains an open problem to \"derandomize\" our argument.

We will estimate the integral, in what is perhaps not the most illuminating way, by expressing it in terms of the matrix entries of U. Let Us,ab = Rh0| S hs|U|ai A|biB. Expanding gives Z Tr h (N ⊗ N¯ )(|ΦihΦ|) i dU (A1) = |S| X a1,a a ′ ,a′ X b1,b b ′ ,b′ X s1,s s ′ ,s′ Z U¯ s1,a2b2U¯ s2,a′ b1U¯s ′ ,a′ b ′ U¯ s ′ ,a1b ′ Us1,a1b1Us2,a′ b2Us ′ ,a′ b ′ Us ′ ,a2b ′ dU. Following [63, 64], the non-zero terms in the sum can be represented using a simple graphical notation. Make two parallel columns of four dots, then label the left-hand dots by the indices (s1, s2, s′ , s′ ) and the right-hand dots by the indices ~v = (a2b2, a′ b1, a′ b ′ , a1b ′ ). Join dots with a solid line if the corresponding U¯ matrix entry appears in Eq. (A1). Since terms integrate to a nonzero value only if the vector of U indices ~w = (a1b1, a′ b2, a′ b ′ , a2b ′ ) is a permutation of the vector of U¯ indices, a non-zero integral can be represented by using a dotted line to connect left-hand and right-hand dots whenever the corresponding U matrix entry appears in the integral. Assuming for the moment that the vertex labels in the left column are all distinct and likewise for the right column, the integral evaluates to the Weingarten function Wg(π), where π is the permutation such that wi = vπ(i). For the rough estimate required here, it is sufficient to know that Wg(π) = Θ(|A||B|) −4−|π| , where |π| is the minimal number of factors required to write π as a product of transpositions, and that Wg(e) = (|A||B|) − 1 + O(|A| − |B| − ) [65]. The dominant contribution to Eq. (A1) comes from the \"stack\" diagram • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ , in which the solid and dashed lines are parallel and for which the contribution is positive and approximately equal to |S| X a1,a a ′ ,a′ X b1,b b ′ ,b′ X s1,s s ′ ,s′ δa1a2δb1b2δa ′ a ′ δb ′ b ′ 2 Wg(id) = |S| |A| 2|B| 1 + O(|A| − |B| − ) . (A2) (The expression on the left-hand side would be exact but for the terms in which vertex labels are not distinct.) To obtain an estimate of Eq. (A1), it is then sufficient to examine the other terms and confirm that they are all of smaller asymptotic order than this. There are six diagrams representing transpositions, and their associated (negative) contributions are • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a2b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b ′ N N N N p p p p Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a2b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b = = = = = Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a2b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a1b1, Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ p p p p N N N N Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a1b a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ = = = = = Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b a ′ b1 = a1b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ N N N N p p p p Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ). For permutations π such that |π| > 1, the Weingarten function is significantly suppressed: Wg(π) = O(|A| − |B| − ). Moreover, for a given diagram type, the requirement that wi = vπ(i) can only hold if at least two pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. The contribution from such diagrams is therefore O(|S| |A| − |B| − ). To finish the proof, it is necessary to consider integrals in which the vertex labels on the left- or the right-hand side of a diagram are not all distinct. In this more general case, choosing a set C of representatives for the conjugacy classes of the permutation group on four elements, the value of the integral can be written X c∈C N(c)Wg(c), (A3) where N(c) = X σ∈S : ~v=σ(~v) X τ∈S : ~w=τ(~w) δ(τπσ ∈ c). (A4) These formulas have a simple interpretation. Symmetry in the vertex labels introduces ambiguities in the diagrammatic notation; the formula states that every one of the diagrams consistent with a given vertex label set must be counted, and with a defined dimension-independent multiplicity. Conveniently, our crude estimates have already done exactly that, ignoring the multiplicities. The only case for which we need to know the multiplicities, moreover, is for contributions to the dominant term, which we want to know exactly and not just up to a constant multiple. We claim that in the sum (A1) there are at most O(|S| |A||B| ) terms with vertex label symmetry. The total contribution for terms with vertex label symmetries τ and σ in which |τπσ| ≥ 1 is therefore of size O(|S| |A| − |B| − ) and does not affect the dominant term. To see why the claim holds, fix a diagram type and recall that the requirement wi = vπ(i)for a permutation π can only hold if at least two pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. Equality is achieved only when all the A indices or all the B indices are aligned, corresponding to the following two diagrams: • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b a ′ b1 = a1b a ′ b ′ 2 = a2b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b ′ N N N N p p p p N N N N p p p p • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a2b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b a1b ′ 1 = a1b N N N N p p p p For the first diagram, using the fact that |A| ≤ |B| ≤ |S|, it is easy to check that imposing the extra constraint that either the top or bottom two S or AB vertex labels match singles at most O(|S| |A||B| ) terms from Eq. (A1). Similar reasoning applies to the second diagram, but imposing the constraint instead on rows one and four, or two and three. For all other diagram types, at least four pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. (The number of matching A and B indices is necessarily even.) In a term for which the vertex labels are not all distinct, either a pair of S indices or a further pair of A or B indices must be identical. In the latter case, there must exist an identical A pair and an identical B pair among all the pairs. Again using |A| ≤ |B| ≤ |S|, there can be at most O(|S| |B| ) such terms per diagram type, which demonstrates the claim. We are thus left to consider integrals with vertex label symmetry and N(e) 6= 0 in Eq. (A3). If N(e) = 1, then our counting was correct and there is no problem. It is therefore sufficient to bound the number of integrals in which N(e) > 1. This can occur only in terms with at least 2 vertex label symmetries. Running the argument of the previous paragraph again, for the two diagrams with A or B indices all aligned, this occurs in at most O(|S| |B| ) terms. For the rest of the cases, it is necessary to impose equality on yet another pair of indices, leading again to at most O(|S| |B| ) terms. Since Wg(e) = O(|A| − |B| − ), these contributions are collectively O(|S| |A| − |B| − ). The bound on the error term in Eq. (29) arises by substituting the inequalities |S| ≤ |A||B| and |A| ≤ |B| into each of the estimates calculated above. [1] B. Schumacher. Quantum coding. Physical Review A, 51:2738–2747, 1995. [2] R.

      "1. Introduction Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring. To paraphrase Huneke in [8], the unsubtle finiteness condition that each ideal of R is finitely generated often, in fact, implies subtle forms of finiteness in the ring, many of which are \"uniform.\" By \"uniform\" we mean, for instance, that one element may annihilate the homology of an entire class of complexes, or that an integer known to exist for a certain finite set of data (e.g., a finitely generated module and submodule, along with an ideal), may actually apply uniformly to an infinite data set. The Main Theorem, Theorem 1. below, is of the latter form, but in order to prove it, we have been led to the notion of what we call a Koszul annihilating sequence, which shows a form of finiteness of the former type. Let R be a Noetherian ring and let M ⊆ N be finitely generated R-modules. For an ideal I ⊆ R, the classical Artin-Rees Lemma states that there exists an integer h, depending on the ideal I and the inclusion M ⊆ N, such that for all integers n > h, the equality (1.0.1) I nN ∩ M = In−h (I hN ∩ M) holds. A weaker form of this statement, which is often used in applications, is that for all integers n > h, the following inclusion holds: (1.0.2) I nN ∩ M ⊆ In−hM. The proof of the equality in equation 1.0.1 uses the fact that the associated graded ring of R with respect to I and the associated graded modules of M and N with respect to I are Noetherian. With this approach, the integer h above, which is referred to as the Artin-Rees number, clearly depends on all of the data, that is, on I and on M ⊆ N. Eisenbud and Hochster, in [5], first raised the question of whether or not there might be an integer h as in equality 1.0.1 which, given M ⊆ N, works for all the maximal ideals in the ring R. In this paper, the term \"uniform Artin-Rees\" was used for the first time, and an example in a non-excellent ring was given to show that some condition on the ring is required in order to find a uniform Artin-Rees number that works for all maximal ideals. In fact, for excellent rings, Duncan and O'Carroll in [3] obtained a uniform Artin-Rees number for which equation 1.0. holds for every maximal ideal, answering Eisenbud and Hochster's question. Their work was preceeded by O'Carroll, who proved in [10] that an integer h can be chosen to uniformly satisfy Date: September 8, 2021. The third author was supported by an AWM grant from May12th to June 12th, 2009. The grant was used to visit the first author. 12 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI inclusion 1.0.2 for all maximal ideals of an excellent ring. In [8], Huneke showed that, given the inclusion M ⊆ N, the integer h in inclusion 1.0.2 can be chosen independently of the ideal I under mild assumptions on the ring, for example when the ring is essentially of finite type over a local ring (by \"local\" we include the condition of being Noetherian). Huneke's result gives a lot of information even in a local ring, whereas the O'Carroll and Duncan/O'Carroll results have content only in rings with infinitely many maximal ideals. Our focus in this paper will remain on local rings, with an emphasis on uniform results over the set of all ideals. The impetus for our results is a \"uniform Artin-Rees\" problem raised by Eisenbud and Huneke in [6], concerning uniform bounds of Artin-Rees type on free resolutions. Let M be a finitely generated R-module and let (F•, ∂•) be a free resolution of M by finitely generated free modules: . . . /Fi+ ∂i+ /Fi/ . . . /F ∂ /F /M / 0. We define a module M to be syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to a family of ideals I, if there exists a uniform integer h such that for every n > h, for every i > 0, and for every I ∈ I, I nFi ∩ Im ∂i+1 ⊆ In−h (1.0.3) Im ∂i+1. This definition does not depend on the free resolution (see for example Lemma 2.1 in [11]). Eisenbud and Huneke raise the question (Question B in [6]) of whether or not, given a local ring (R, m) and an ideal I ⊆ R, every module is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to I = {I}. In [6], the authors show that given a local ring (R, m), a module M is syzygetically ArtinRees with respect to an ideal I ⊆ R, if M has finite projective dimension and constant rank on the punctured spectrum. In [11], the third author of this paper observed that much stronger statements could be made if one looks at high enough syzygies. She proved that every second syzygy module in a local ring of dimension at most two has a certain uniform annihilation property with respect to the family of m-primary ideals (see Theorem 5.4 of [11]). Although it is never formally stated in her paper, one can deduce from her results that in a local ring of dimension two, every finitely generated second syzygy is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to the set of m-primary ideals, and that the integer h in inclusion 1.0.3 can be chosen independently of the module M, i.e., we have a double uniform Artin-Rees theorem. This leads us to an extended definition: We say that a family of modules M is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to a family of ideals I if there exists an h such that inclusion 1.0.3 holds for every module of M and every ideal of I. It is in this form that we prove our main theorem. (1.1) Main Theorem. Let (R, m) be a local Noetherian ring of dimension d. Then, the family of finitely generated dth syzygy modules is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to the family of all ideals. It quickly becomes apparent, when considering this problem over infinite sets of ideals and modules, that no uniform statement is possible when we consider the beginning of a resolution, even in very nice rings. Suppose that (R, m) is Cohen-Macaulay (or even regular) and x1, . . . , xd is a system of parameters. The Koszul complex K•(x t , . . . , xt d ; R) is a free resolution of the module R/(x t , . . . , xt d ). This complex will have Artin-Rees number at least t for the ideal (x1, . . . , xd). But there is a uniform behavior for all such complexes past d, since all higher syzygies are zero. The syzygetically Artin-Rees property is intertwined with finding uniform annihilators for homology modules. In fact, given a free resolution (F•, ∂•) of an R-module M, there is an isomorphism I nFi−1 ∩ Im(∂i) I nIm ∂i ∼= TorR i (R/In(1.1.1) , M), for every i > 1.UNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES Our work to find uniform annihilator elements for the homology module displayed above, is inspired by the ideas contained in the monograph [7], which also relate to important homological conjectures. In this monograph, the authors show that elements that annihilate higher homology modules of Koszul complexes on sequences that are part of a system of parameters, can often, after taking a power, annihilate higher homology modules of a much wider class of complexes. Huneke's proof of his uniform Artin-Rees and uniform Brian¸con-Skoda theorems also relies heavily on such elements. In order to prove our Main Theorem, given a local ring (R, m), we need a sequence of elements which annihilate higher Koszul homology modules of parameters. As we need this sequence to itself form a system of parameters, we are forced to choose elements that annihilate higher Koszul homology of part of system of parameters of appropriate length. This leads us to introduce the notion of Koszul annihilating sequence (KAS), whose precise definition, Definition 2.3, is given in Section 2, together with the proof of its existence, Theorem 2.6. We believe that KAS sequences may offer a significant tool in problems where controlling higher homology modules for classes of free complexes is important. Section 3 is devoted to showing how Koszul annihilating sequences uniformly annihilate the homology modules of a much larger class of complexes. Finally, in Section 4, after proving several lemmas, we give the proof of Theorem 4.8 of which the Main Theorem is a corollary. 2. Koszul annihilating sequences Throughout this section, R will denote a Noetherian ring of dimension d. Let x = x1, . . . , xn be a sequence of elements in R, and let M be an R-module. We denote the Koszul complex on the sequence x and the module M by K•(x1, . . . , xn; M), and we denote its ith homology by Hi(x1, . . . , xn; M). This section is devoted to showing, given a local ring (R, m), the existence of a system of parameters, which we call a Koszul annihilating sequence (or KAS), whose elements uniformly annihilate higher homology modules of the Koszul complex on sequences that are part of a system of parameters against all modules that are high syzygies. The precise definition of KAS is given in Definition 2.3, and the existence of such a sequence for the class of dth szyzygies is the content of Theorem 2.6. As mentioned in the introduction, our work is inspired by the monograph of Hochster and Huneke. The first result we need to modify is the following which is Theorem (2.16) of [7]. For a finitely generated module M, the height of I on M, htM I, is the height of the ideal I in the ring R/ AnnR M. (2.1) Let R be a Noetherian ring, not necessarily local. Let x1, . . . , xn be elements in the ring R and suppose that M is a finitely generated R-module of dimension d ′ such that the inequality htM(x1, . . . , xi) > i is satisfied for all i = 1, . . . , n. Let c be an element of R such that, for i = 0, . . . , n − 1, the equality cHi pRp (Mp) = 0 holds for any prime ideal p containing the elements x1, . . . , xi+1. Then the equality c E(d ′ ,n,t)Hn−t(x1, . . . , xn; M) = 0 holds for 0 6 t 6 n − 1, where, for integers δ > ν > τ > 0, the function E(δ, ν, τ) is defined recursively as follows: ( E(δ, ν, 0) = δ − ν + E(δ, ν, τ) = δ + (δ + 2)E(δ, ν − 1, τ − 1), τ > 1. We provide here an alternative version of result 2.1, with essentially the same proof as given in [7]. With stronger hypotheses on R, we may look only at the height of the sequence on R (not on the module M), and we may drop the dimension assumption on M. This is valuable for4 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI our applications to syzygies as we do not always know that syzygies have the full dimension of the ring. On the other hand, the hypotheses on the ring will be satisfied as we will apply our theorem to Gorenstein rings. In our case, we define a new function E1(δ, ν, τ) recursively by ( E1(δ, ν, 0) = δ − ν + E1(δ, ν, τ) = δ + (δ + 2)E1(δ − 1, ν − 1, τ − 1), τ > 1. (2.2) Theorem. Let R be a Noetherian ring of dimension d which is catenary and locally equidimensional at each maximal ideal. Let x = x1, . . . , xn be a sequence of elements of R for which the inequality htR(x1, . . . , xi)R > i holds for all integers i with 1 6 i 6 n. Let M be a finitely generated R-module, and let c ∈ R be an element such that the equality cHi pRp (Mp) = 0 holds for any prime ideal p containing the sequence x1, . . . , xi+1 and for 0 6 i 6 n − 1. Then, the equality c E1(d,n,t)Hn−t(x; M) = 0 holds for 0 6 t 6 n − 1. Proof. We use induction on d, n, and t. The property of being equidimensional at maximal ideals localizes and the statement is a local one on R at maximal ideals. Moreover, if m is a maximal ideal of R then htR m 6 d. Since for d ′ 6 d we have E1(d′ , n, t) 6 E1(d, n, t), without loss of generality we may assume that (R, m) is a local Noetherian catenary and equidimensional ring of dimension d. If t = 0, we shall show that Hn(x; M) is annihilated by c d−n+1. We can assume that n > 1. If n > d, then (x)R = R and all Koszul homologies vanish. If d = n, then (x) generates an m-primary ideal and Hn(x; M) ⊆ H m(M), which is annihilated by c by hypothesis. We may thus assume that n < d. Consider c d−nHn(x; M). By the induction hypothesis on d, this module vanishes on the punctured spectrum. The module is also a submodule of M, and hence c d−nHn(x; M) ⊆ H m(M). By hypothesis, c is in the annihilator of the module c d−nHn(x; M). We now assume that t > 0. Let N = annM (x1) = H1(x1; M). We may apply the case t = and n = 1 to see that c d is in the annihilator of the module N. Consider the two exact sequences (2.2.1) 0 → N → M → M′ → 0, and (2.2.2) 0 → M′ → M → M/x1M → 0, where M′ = x1M ∼= M/N. Let r be an integer with 0 6 r 6 n − 1 and p a prime ideal containing x1, . . . , xr+1. The short exact sequence 2.2.1 yields the following long exact sequence: (2.2.3) · · · → H i pRp (Mp) → Hi pRp (M′ p ) → H i+ pRp (Np) → · · · . Since the equality c dN = 0 holds, then cd is in the annihilator of the third module displayed in 2.2.3 for all i > 0; by hypothesis c annihilates the first module displayed in 2.2.3 for all i 6 r. Thus, for i 6 r, c d+1Hi pRp (M′ p ) = 0. In particular, c d+1 kills the third term displayed below for all i < r (2.2.4) · · · → H i pRp (Mp) → H i pRp ((M/x1M)p) → H i+ pRp (M′ p ) → · · · , where the long exact sequence comes from the short exact sequence 2.2.2. Hence, for all i < r, c d+2 kills the middle term in 2.2.4, since by hypothesis cHi pRp (Mp) = 0 for i 6 r. Because R is equidimensional and catenary of dimension d, the ring R/x1R is equidimensional and catenary of dimension d − 1, and htR ((x2, . . . , xi+1)(R/x1R)) > i. We apply the induction hypothesis with M/x1M replacing M, R/x1R replacing R, x2, . . . , xn replacing the original sequence, c d+2 replacing c, and d − 1, n − 1, t − 1 replacing d, n, and t respectively to conclude that c (d+2)E1(d−1,n−1,t−1) kills Hn−t(x2, . . . , xn; M/x1M).UNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES Finally, from a spectral sequence there is a long exact sequence · · · → Hi−1(x2, . . . , xn; N) → Hi(x; M) → Hi(x2, . . . , xn; M/x1M) → · · · . Let i = n − t. Since c d annihilates the first displayed term and c(d+2)E1(d−1,n−1,t−1) annihilates the third term, we obtain that c E1(d,n,t)Hi(x; M) = 0, as required. We are now ready to give the definition of a Koszul annihilating sequence. (2.3) Definition. Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d and let M be a finitely generated R-module. Given an integer i such that i 6 d, a sequence of elements, ci, ci+1, . . . , cd ∈ m is a Koszul annihilating sequence (KAS) for M (of length d − i + 1), if (1) the elements ci, . . . , cd are part of a system of parameters for R, and (2) for all integers k such that d > k > i − 1, if x1, . . . , xk, ck+1, . . . , cd are a system of parameters for R, then the equality cvHn(x1, . . . , xk, ct k+1, . . . , ctj ; M) = holds for all v > j > k > 1 and for all n, t > 1. If M is a family of finitely generated R-modules, and ci, . . . , cd is a KAS for all M ∈ M, then we will say that the sequence is a KAS for M. (2.4) Remark. It is clear from the definition that if we modify a KAS by replacing each element by a power of itself, we still have a KAS. Moreover a KAS of length dim R is a system of parameters for R. Theorem 2.6 below shows that for any local ring, it is always possible to find a KAS of length d for the class of modules which are dth syzygies. Before proving the theorem, we introduce some ideals that will be used in the proof. (2.5) Let (R, m) be a local ring. For an integer i such that 0 6 i < d, set ai = ai(R) = AnnR Hi m(R) and bi = bi(R) = a0(R)· · · ai(R). It is a simple induction to see that if M is a jth syzygy then for 0 6 i < j, bi ⊆ AnnR Hi m(M). In particular, for every dth syzygy, and for every 0 6 i < d, bi ⊆ AnnR Hi m(M). We also note that b0 ⊇ b1 ⊇ · · · ⊇ bd−1 and dim R/bi 6 i. (2.6) Theorem. Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d. Then, there exists a KAS sequence, c1, . . . , cd, for the family of finitely generated modules which are dth syzygies over R. Moreover, the KAS sequence c1, . . . , cd can be chosen such that the following holds dim R/(0 :R (0 :R cd−i)) 6 d − i − 1, for all 1 6 i 6 d − 1. Proof. We begin by choosing c ′ d ∈ bd−1 − S p∈Assh R p, where Assh R denotes the set of associated prime ideals p of maximal dimension, i.e., dim R/p = dim R. This choice is possible, since dim R/bd−1 6 d − 1 by 2.5, and therefore, by prime avoidance, bd−1 is not contained in any minimal prime of R of maximal dimension. Inductively, having chosen c ′ d , . . . , c′ i+1, we pick c ′ i ∈ bi−1 − [ {p | p ∈ AsshR R/(c ′ i+1, . . . , c′ d )} ∪ {p | p ∈ Ass R, dimR R/p > i} . We can avoid all the above primes in question since dim R/bi−1 6 i − 1 by 2.5. For 1 6 i 6 d, set ci = (c ′ i ) E1(d,d,d−1) . The elements cd, . . . , c1 form a system of parameters in R, and hence in Rb. Let (S, n) be a Gorenstein ring of dimension d mapping onto Rb, say Rb = S/I. Again, using prime avoidance, we6 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI may lift c1, . . . , cd to elements in S which form a system of parameters in S. Abusing terminology, we will continue to call the elements c1, . . . , cd. For all Rb modules, the action of the lifted elements is the same as the action of the ci's. Let M be a finitely generated dth Rb-syzygy. Suppose that x1, . . . , xk ∈ S are elements such that x1, . . . , xk, ck+1, . . . , cd are a system of parameters in S. We want to show that, given integers v > j > k and t, n > 1, the equality cvHn(x1, . . . , xk, ct k+1, . . . , ct j ; M) = 0 holds. By Theorem 2.2, it suffices to show that the equality c ′ vHi pSp (Mp) = 0 holds whenever the index i satisfies 0 6 i 6 j − 1 and the prime ideal p ∈ Spec(S) is such that (y1, . . . , yi+1) ⊆ p, where ym = xm for 1 6 m 6 k and ym = c t m otherwise. Fix an integer i ∈ {0, . . . , j − 1}, by local duality the cohomology module Hi pSp (Mp) is dual to Extht p−i S (M, S)p; further the module Extht p−i S (M, S) is dual to the cohomology module H d−ht p+i n (M). If v > d − ht p + i + 1 then, using 2.5, the equality cvH d−ht p+i n (M) = holds, as the element cv ∈ bv−1 ⊆ bd−ht p+i. Thus we may assume that v < d − ht p + i + 1, or, equivalently, that ht p < d−v +i+ 1. We claim that the ideal p does not contain all the elements cd, . . . , cd−(ht p−i−1). Indeed if p would contain these elements as well as y1, . . . , yi+1, then p contains at least ht p + 1 elements from a system of parameters for the ring S, contradicting the Gorenstein assumption on S. Therefore p does not contain all the elements cd, . . . , cd−(ht p−i−1) so that the module Extht p−i S (M, S)p vanishes, as its annihilator contains the elements cd, . . . , cd−(ht p−i−1). Hence the hypotheses of Theorem 2.2 hold. In particular, this shows that c1, . . . , cd is a KAS for Rb. Note that the elements c1, . . . , cd live in R. Because Rb is faithfully flat over R, if M is a finitely generated dth syzygy over R then M ⊗R Rb is a dth syzygy over Rb. Also, − ⊗R Rb commutes with taking Koszul homology so the vanishing condition over Rb implies the same vanishing over R. Thus c1, . . . , cd is a KAS over R. Since we picked each ci to avoid appropriate associated primes of R, we also have that dim R/(0 :R (0 :R cd−i)) 6 d − i − 1 for each i. KAS sequences annihilate homology modules of Koszul complexes on every sequence x (of appropriate length) that is part of a system of parameters. However, in Lemma 4.6, we will need to carefully choose sequences x with properties that are captured by the following definition. (2.7) Definition. Let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS for a family of modules M. A system of parameters x = x1, . . . , xd is said to be well-suited to c if for all 1 6 i 6 j 6 d, any subset of cardinality d − (j − i + 1) of the sequence x together with the sequence ci, . . . , cj is a system of parameters for R. Using this definition (with j = d and j = d−1 respectively), the two equalities in the following corollary are particular cases of Theorem 2.6. (2.8) Corollary. Let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS sequence for the family of modules which are dth syzygies and let x1, . . . , xd be a well-suited sequence to c. Then cvHt(x1, . . . , xk, ck+1, . . . , cℓ; M) = 0, cvHt(x1, . . . , xk, ck, . . . , cℓ−1; M) = 0, for all integers v > ℓ > k > 1, for all t > 1, and for all R-modules M that are dth syzygies. 3. Uniform annihilators of homology As shown in [7], elements that annihilate the Koszul homology are also in the annihilator of the homology modules of a wider class of complexes. In this section we look at a class ofUNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES complexes described, for instance, in Definition (3.16) of [7] and we study their relations with KAS sequences. Let (G•, ∂•) be a complex of finitely generated free modules: /Gn ∂n /Gn− / . . . /G ∂ /G0/ where n is the length of the complex. For a positive integer r, denote by Ir(∂i) the ideal generated by the r × r minors of a matrix that represents the map ∂i after a choice of basis (the ideal is independent of the choice). The rank of the homomorphism ∂iis given by rank ∂i = max{r | Ir(∂i) 6= 0}. Denote by I(∂i) the ideal Irank ∂i(∂i). The complex (G•, ∂•) satisfies the standard conditions on rank if the following equality holds for i = 1, . . . , n: rankR Gi = rank ∂i + rank ∂i+1. (3.1) The standard conditions on rank play a very important role on the exactness of a complex. Buchsbaum and Eisenbud show in [2] that a complex of free modules /Gn ∂n /Gn− / . . . /G ∂ /G0/ is exact if and only if it satisfies the standard conditions on rank and depthR I(∂i) > i for all integers i > 1. The proof of 3.1 uses several lemmas. We report two of them for easy reference. One could consult Proposition 1.4.10 of [1] or refer to the original paper [2] for a proof. (3.2) Let ∂ : F1 → F0 be a homomorphism between two free R-modules. Denote by M the cokernel of ∂. Then I(∂) = R if and only if M is a free module of rank equal to rank F0−rank(∂). (3.3) Let 0 → Gn → · · · → G0 be a complex of free modules that satisfies the standard conditions on rank. Assume that I(∂i) = R for all i = 1, . . . , n then the complex is split exact. Our first proposition will show how a KAS sequence annihilates the homology of complexes which are the tensor product of high syzygies and certain complexes satisfying the standard conditions on rank. We will use the following result, which is Proposition 3.1 of [7]. The statement in the original publication has a typo, so we restate it here. (3.4) Let R be an arbitrary commutative ring and let M• be a complex 0 → Mn → · · · → M1 → M0 → of arbitrary R-modules. Let x = x1, . . . , xn be a sequence of elements in R, and let d, d0, d1, . . . , dn−2 be elements of R such that (1) di kills Hn−i(M•), for 0 6 i 6 n − 2 (this is where the correction is), and (2) d kills Hn−j (x1, . . . , xn; Mj+1), for 1 6 j 6 n − 1. Then D = (d0d1 . . . dn−2)d n kills HomR(R/(x1, . . . , xn), H1(M•)). (3.5) Proposition. Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d and let c1, . . . , cd be a KAS for the family of modules which are dth syzygies. Then there exists an integer t > 0 such that c t n+jHi(G• ⊗ M) = 0, for all integers i and j such that i > 1, 0 6 j 6 d − n, for every dth syzygy M, and for every complex (G•, ∂•) of length n 6 d of finitely generated free R-modules with the following properties:8 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI (1) G• satisfies the standard conditions on rank, (2) For 1 6 i 6 n, the ideal I(∂i) + (ci+1, . . . , cd) is m-primary. Proof. Denote by bi the rank of the free module Gi. We use reverse induction on the homological degree of the complex G•. At homological degree n, the complex looks like 0 → Gn → Gn−1, with ∂n : Gn → Gn−1. By hypothesis I(∂n) + (cn+1, . . . , cd) is m-primary. Choose elements y1, . . . , yn ∈ I(∂n) such that the sequence y1, . . . , yn, cn+1, . . . , cd forms a system of parameters. Then for each 1 6 i 6 n, we obtain I(∂n)yi= Ryi . The content of 3.2 implies that the cokernel of (∂n)yiis a free module of rank equal to bn−1 − rank(∂n)yi = bn−1 − bn, where the last equality holds since the complex G• satisfies the standard conditions on rank. In particular, the sequence 0 → (Gn)yi → (Gn−1)yi → Coker(∂n)yi → is a split exact sequence. Let M be a dth syzygy and let z ∈ Hn(G•⊗M) ⊆ Gn⊗M. Then (Gn⊗M)yi → (Gn−1⊗M)yi is injective for each i such that 0 6 i 6 n, so there is an integer s such that y s i z = 0 for each i such that 1 6 i 6 n, and therefore z ∈ Hn(y s , . . . , ys n ; Gn ⊗ M). By Corollary 2.8, each of cn, . . . , cd kills this homology, and so each kills z. Suppose that the conclusion holds for all complexes of length n, at each homological degree greater than m (with 1 6 m < n). In particular, there exists an integer k such that c k n , . . . , ck d annihilate Hi(G• ⊗ M) for all i > m. We need to show that there is a power of the elements cn, . . . , cd that annihilates Hm(G• ⊗ M). Pick y1, . . . , ym ∈ I(∂m) such that y1, . . . , ym, cm+1, . . . , cd are a system of parameters. For each 1 6 i 6 m, the localized subcomplex 0 → (Gn)yi → · · · → (Gm)yi → (Gm−1)yiis split exact since the complex satisfies the hypothesis of 3.3. Hence, given a dth syzygy M, there is a power s such that (y s , . . . , ys m) kills the homology Hm(G• ⊗ M). This implies that there is a homomorphism that sends the identity in R/(y s , . . . , ys m) to any element z ∈ Hm(G• ⊗ M). As the elements ci's are part of a KAS, we may now apply the content of 3.4 to the complex (0 → Gn → · · · → Gm−1 → 0) ⊗ M with each d0 = · · · = dn−m−1 = c k j and d = cj for j > n. Thus c (n−m)k+n−m+ j kills the desired homology. We now look at the particular complex we will use. (3.6) Remark. Let x = x1, . . . , xh be a sequence elements of a ring R. Consider the n×(n+h−1) matrix B =   x1 x2 . . . xh 0 . . . . . . 0 x1 x2 . . . xh 0 . . . . . . 0 0 . . . . . . xh   . The n × n minors of B are the generators of the ideal J n, where J = (x1, . . . , xh). In [4] the authors construct a complex (B J,n • , ∂•) such that H0(B J,n • ) = R/Jn. Theorem 2 of [4] says that if x is a regular sequence, then the complex (B J,n • , ∂•) is a free resolution of R/Jn of length h. Moreover, J ⊆ p I(∂i) for all i = 1, . . . , h. Using the particular complex above, we are finally able to list in the following proposition all the results that are used in the next section. (3.7) Proposition. Let (R, m, k) be a local ring of dimension d, let M be the family of all finitely generated R-modules that are dth syzygies,and let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS sequence for M. Let x1, . . . , xd be a system of parameters well-suited to c and denote by Ij the ideal (x1, . . . xj ). LetUNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES t be the integer given by Proposition 3.5 for c. For every i and j such that 1 6 j 6 i 6 n and for any positive integers tj+1, . . . , ti the following hold: (1) the complex (B Ij ,n • , ∂•)⊗K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ; R) (where if j = i there is no Koszul complex) satisfies conditions (1) and (2) of Proposition 3.5; (2) c t k TorR (R/(I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i )), M) = 0, for all M ∈ M and for all k = i, . . . , d; (3) c t k (I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ))G ∩ N ⊆ I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ) N, for all modules N and free modules G such that N ⊆ G and G/N ∈ M, and for all k = i, . . . , d; (4) c t k (I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti− i− ))M : c∞ i ⊆ I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti− i− ) M, for all k = i, . . . , d. Proof. For (1), let S = Z[X1, . . . , Xd, C1, . . . , Cd] be the polynomial ring in 2d variables and define the ring homomorphism ψ : S → R such that ψ(Xj ) = xj and ψ(Cj ) = cj . Denote by Xj the sequence X1, . . . , Xj . By Remark 3.6, the complex B Xj ,n is a free resolution over S of the ideal (X1, . . . , Xj ) n. Since the elements C1, . . . , Cd are a regular sequence over the S-module H0(B Xj ,n) = S/(X1, . . . , Xj ) n, the complex B Xj ,n ⊗S K•(C tj+ j+1 , . . . , Ctii ; S) is a free resolution of S/((X1, . . . , Xj ) n, Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti i ) and therefore it satisfies the standard conditions on rank by 3.1. By induction on the length of the Koszul complex and using 3.6, one can see that each ideal of rank-size minors is, up to radical, the ideal (X1, . . . , Xj , Cj+1, . . . , Ci). Base change to R clearly preserves the rank in this case, as well as condition (2) of Proposition 3.5. For (2), denote by F• a minimal free resolution of R/(I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i )). The complexes F• and BIj ,n ⊗ K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ) are identical up to homological degree 1 and up to a change of base. Therefore, as F• is exact, there is a chain map from BIj ,n ⊗ K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ) to F• that lifts the identity between the free modules of homological degree 1. This chain map induces the following surjection H1(B Ij ,n ⊗ K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i ; R) ⊗R M) → TorR (R/(I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i )), M). So it is enough to show that c t kH1(B Ij ,n ⊗ K•(c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti i (3.7.1) ; R) ⊗R M) = 0. This follows from part (1) and Proposition 3.5. Statement (3) follows from (2) by isomorphism 1.1.1, for i = 1. For (4), denote the first and the second maps of the complex B Xj ,n ⊗ K•(C tj+ j+1 , . . . , Ctii ; S) by Φ1 and Φ2. Such complex is a free resolution of S/((X1, . . . , Xj) n, Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti i ) and therefore the entries of the last row of a matrix representing Φ2 generate the ideal ((X1, . . . , Xj) n , Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti− i− : C ti i ) which is equal to ((X1, . . . , Xj ) n , Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti− i− ) for each value of ti since the elements X1, . . . , Xj , Cj+1, . . . , Ci form a regular sequence. Let z ∈ (I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti− i− ))M : c∞ i , there exists a tuple z ∈ Ker(Φ1 ⊗S IdM ), for which z is the last entry. Notice that equation 3.7.1 reads c t kKer(Φ1 ⊗R IdM ) ⊆ Im(Φ2 ⊗R IdM ). Therefore, c t k z ∈ Im(Φ2 ⊗S IdM ) = Im(Φ2)⊗S IdM . By reading this inclusion componentwise, we obtain that c t kz ∈ ((X1, . . . , Xj ) n , Ctj+ j+1 , . . . , Cti− i− ) ⊗S M = (I n j + (c tj+ j+1 , . . . , c ti− i− ))M, which finishes the proof of the proposition. 10 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI 4. Proof of the Main Theorem In this section, (R, m) will be a local ring of dimension d. If (S, n) is a faithfully flat local extension of R then the conclusion of the Main Theorem descends from S to R. Hence we may always assume that R has an infinite residue field. The idea behind the proof of the Main Theorem is to first pick a KAS, then reduce the statement to families of m-primary ideals generated by minimal reductions (which are then systems of parameters) and then, by picking a generic generating set for the reduction, change the calculation from the reduction to the KAS. Recall that given an ideal I ⊆ R, a reduction of I is an ideal J ⊆ I such that there exists an integer k satisfying the equality I k+1 = JIk , which in turn implies that I n ⊆ Jn−k , for all n > k. If J ⊆ I is a reduction of I then I = J. When (R, m) has an infinite residue field, minimal reductions of an ideal always exist. For a comprehensive treatment one may consult [9]. We will rely heavily on Huneke's Uniform Brian¸con-Skoda Theorem (Theorem 4.13 in [8]). We present it in a less general form which is adequate for our needs. (4.1) Let (R, m, k) be a complete reduced Noetherian ring. There exists a positive integer k such that for all ideals I ⊆ R, the inclusion I n ⊆ I n−k holds for all n > k. Our next theorem shows that the integer k in the definition of a reduction of an ideal can be uniformly chosen to work for all ideals and for all reductions. (4.2) Theorem. Let (R, m, k) be a complete local ring. There exists a positive integer k such that for all ideals I and all reductions J ⊆ I, the inclusion I n ⊆ Jn−k holds for all n > k. Proof. Denote by N the nilradical of the ring R. If N = 0, we are done by Theorem 4.1, since I n ⊆ J n. By Noetherian induction, for any non-zero element x ∈ N, the result holds, since the property of being a reduction is preserved modulo nilpotent elements. We can assume that x 2 = 0. Let k1 be an integer which works mod xR, and let k2 be the UAR number for xR ⊆ R. Then I n ⊆ Jn−k1 + (xR∩In−k1 ) ⊆ Jn−k1 +xIn−k1−k2 ⊆ Jn−k1 +x(Jn−2k1−k2 +xR) ⊆ Jn−2k1−k . We need a notion of reduction that relates to the notion of KAS sequences. (4.3) Definition. Let I be an m-primary ideal and c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS sequence. A special reduction of I with respect to c is a sequence x1, . . . , xd which is well-suited to c and verifies the following, for all integers i such that 0 6 i 6 d − 1: (1) Id−i−1 is a reduction of Id−i modulo (cd−i, . . . , cd) (2) Id−i−1 is a reduction of Id−i modulo (0 : (0 : cd−i)), where Ik denotes the ideal generated by x1, . . . , xk. We also set I0 = 0. (4.4) Remark. Special reductions exist if the residue field is infinite. We need to pick the KAS sequence such that dimR R/(0 : (0 : cd−i)) 6 d − i − 1, and this is possible by Theorem 2.6. Suppose that we have picked a KAS, c = c1, . . . , cd. There are only finitely many ideals generated by the subsets of {c1, . . . , cd}. Thus, with an infinite field, one can choose d general generators of the ideal I that will both be well-suited to c and satisfy the reduction conditions (1) and (2) of Definition 4.3. We now collect the steps that will reduce the proof of the Main Theorem for the family of all ideals to the family of ideals generated by sequences that are special reductions. (4.5) The following statements hold: (1) If the Main Theorem holds for the family of all m-primary ideals then it will hold for the family of all ideals, as I = \\ n> (I + m n ) by the Krull Intersection Theorem.UNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES (2) In view of Theorem 4.2, we can reduce the proof of our Main Theorem to a family of ideals that are special reductions of m-primary ideals. We now present the technique that will allow to use an induction on the number of elements of the sequences. Before we need a technical lemma. (4.6) Lemma. Let (R, m) be a local ring and let N be a dth syzygy. Let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS sequence with respect to the family of modules that are dth syzygies, and let t be the integer given by Proposition 3.5 for c. Assume that the sequence of elements x1, . . . , xd is well-suited to c. Let w be an element in N. If there exists an integer h such that c t jw ∈ (x1, . . . , xj−1) n−hN + (c (i−j+1)t i , . . . , c2t j+1)(x1, . . . , xj ) n−hN, where i > j and 1 6 i 6 d, then there exists w1 ∈ (x1, . . . , xj ) n−hN such that c t j (w − w1) ∈ (x1, . . . , xj−1) n−hN + (c (i−j)t i− , . . . , c2t j+ (x1, . . . , xj ) n−hN. Proof. For notational simplicity, replace each c t k by ck, and let Ik be the ideal (x1, . . . , xk) for every integer k such 1 6 k 6 d. Let vi ∈ (x1, . . . , xj ) n−hN be the coefficient of c i−j+ i . Then c i−j+ i vi ∈ cjN + I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1)I n−h j N. In particular, vi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1, cj )N : c i−j+ i . By Proposition 3.7 (4), (4.6.1) civi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1, cj )N. We claim that for every integer r such that 1 6 r 6 i − j + 1, we have (4.6.2) c r i vi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c i−j−r+ i−r+1 )I n−h j N + (c i−j−r+ i−r , . . . , c j+1, cj )N, and we will prove the claim by induction on r. The claim is true for r = 1 by 4.6.1. Assume the claim is true for r > 1. Let ni−r ∈ N be the coefficient of c i−j−r+ i−r in 4.6.2. Then ni−r ∈ I n−h j + (c i−j−r i−r− , . . . , c j+1, cj ) N : c i−j−r+ i−r . By Proposition 3.7 (4), cini−r ∈ I n−h j + (c i−j−r i−r− , . . . , c j+1, cj ) N. Multiplying 4.6.2 by ci and substituting for cini−r yields c r+ i vi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c i−j−r+ i−r+1 , c i−j−r+ i−r )I n−h j N + (c i−j−r i−r− , . . . , c j+1, cj )N, as desired. Therefore, the claim is true for all r = 1, . . . , i − j + 1. In particular, for r = i − j + 1, we obtain c i−j+ i vi ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , cj )I n−h j N. By hypothesis, we have the following containment cjw ∈ I n−h j−1 N + c i−j+ i vi + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1)I n−h j N, which, together with the previous containment, gives cjw ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1, cj)I n−h j N.12 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI We conclude that there exists w1 ∈ I n−h j N such that cj (w − w1) ∈ I n−h j−1 N + (c i−j i− , . . . , c j+1)I n−h j N, which concludes the proof. We will now focus our attention on choosing the sequence x1, . . . , xd to which we can apply the previous lemma. With the same notation as in 4.3, we can state the main reduction that is used to prove the main theorem. (4.7) Proposition. Let (R, m, k) be a local ring of dimension d with an infinite residue field. Let c = c1, . . . , cd be a KAS-sequence of R, and let 0 → N → G → M → 0 be a short exact sequence of finitely generated R-modules where M is a dth syzygy and G is a free R-module. There exists an integer h, depending only on c, such that if I is an m-primary ideal and x1, . . . , xd is a special reduction of I, then for all integers i such that 0 6 i 6 d − 1 and for all n > h, the following inclusion holds I n d−iG ∩ N ⊆ I n−h d−i N + I n−h d−i−1G ∩ N. Proof. Let t be the exponent for c given by Proposition 3.5. For simplicity of notation, we replace each c t i by ci , for each integer i such that 1 6 i 6 d. By Proposition 3.7 (3) with i = j, cd−i(I n d−iG ∩ N) ⊆ I n d−iN. In particular, given an element w ∈ I n d−iG ∩ N, we obtain cd−iw ∈ I n d−iN. Since Id−i−1 is a reduction of Id−i modulo the ideal (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i), there exists an integer h1, which, by Proposition 4.2, depends only on the KAS sequence c, such that I n d−i ⊆ I n−h d−i−1 + (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)R ∩ I n−h d−i (4.7.1) , for all n > h1. By the uniform Artin-Rees property, there exists an integer h2, depending only on the KAS sequence c, such that (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)R ∩ I n−h d−i ⊆ (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)I n−h1−h d−i . Combining this last inclusion with inclusion 4.7.1, and setting h3 equal to h1 + h2, we obtain I n d−i ⊆ I n−h d−i−1 + (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)I n−h d−i , for all n > h3. Thus the containment cd−iw ∈ I n−h d−i−1N + (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1, cd−i)I n−h d−i N holds. It follows that there exists an element w1 ∈ I n−h d−i N such that cd−i(w − w1) ∈ I n−h d−i−1N + (c i+ d , . . . , c d−i+1)I n−h d−i N. By a repeated application of Lemma 4.6, there are elements w2, . . . , wi+1 ∈ I n−h d−i N satisfying cd−i(w − w1 − w2 − · · · − wi+1) ∈ I n−h d−i−1N ⊆ I n−h d−i−1G ∩ cd−iG. By the uniform Artin-Rees property, there exists an integer h4 > h3, depending only on the element cd−i, such that I n−h d−i−1G ∩ cd−iG ⊆ cd−iI n−h d−i−1G. So we obtain cd−i(w − w1 − w2 − · · · − wi+1) ∈ cd−iI n−h d−i−1G, for all n > h4. Therefore there exists an element f ∈ I n−h d−i−1G such that cd−i(w − w1 − w2 − · · · − wi+1 − f) = 0,UNIFORM ARTIN-REES BOUNDS FOR SYZYGIES and then w − w1 − w2 − · · · − wi+1 = f + z, where z ∈ (0 :G cd−i)G. It follows that z ∈ I n−h d−i G ∩ (0 :G cd−i). By the uniform Artin-Rees property, there exists an integer h5 > h4, which depends only on the element cd−i, such that I n−h d−i G ∩ (0 :G cd−i) ⊆ I n−h d−i (0 :G cd−i). Thus z ∈ I n−h d−i (0 :G cd−i), for all n > h5. As Id−i−1 is a reduction of Id−i modulo (0 :R (0 :R cd−i)), there exists an integer h6, depending only on cd−i, such that I n d−i ⊆ I n−h d−i−1 + (0 :R (0 :R cd−i)), for all n > h6. Thus, by setting h equal to h5 + h6, we obtain I n−h d−i (0 :G cd−i)G ⊆ I n−h d−i− (0 :G cd−i)G ⊆ I n−h d−i−1G, which implies that f + z ∈ I n−h d−i−1G. As w − w1 − · · · − wi+1 ∈ N and w − w1 − · · · − wi+1 = f + z, we have w − w1 − · · · − wi+1 ∈ I n−h d−i−1G ∩ N. Thus, w ∈ I n−h d−i N + I n−h d−i−1G ∩ N as desired. We are finally ready to prove the theorem, from which the Main Theorem in the introduction follows as a corollary. (4.8) Theorem. Let (R, m, k) be a local ring of dimension d. There exists an integer h such that for all ideals I ⊆ R and for all short exact sequences of finitely generated modules 0 → A → B → M → 0 with M is a dth syzygy, I nB ∩ A ⊆ In−hA. Proof. If there exists such a bound for any faithfully flat extension of R then the same bound holds for R. Thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that R is complete and has an infinite residue field. We can reduce to the case that the middle module is free as follows. Let G be a free module mapping onto B and let N be the kernel of the composite map from G to M. Then G/N ∼= M and N maps to A (via the snake lemma). If w ∈ I nB ∩ A, then we may lift w to w1 ∈ InG. Since w maps to 0 in M, so does w1, i.e., w1 ∈ I nG ∩ N. So, if w1 ∈ In−hN then w ∈ In−hA. For the rest of the proof, we keep the notation that G is free and G/N ∼= M. Fix a KAS sequence c for the class of finitely generated dth syzygies of R, as given by Theorem 2.6. By 4.5, it is enough to find an integer h such that J nG ∩ N ⊆ Jn−hN for all ideals J that are special reductions of m-primary ideals with respect to the KAS sequence c. Let I = Id = (x1, . . . , xd) be a special reduction. Let k be the integer given by Proposition 4.7. By d applications of Proposition 4.7, I nG ∩ N ⊆ In−kN + (I n−k d−1 G ∩ N) ⊆ · · · ⊆ I n−kN + I n−2k d−1 N + · · · + I n−(d−1)k 2 N + I n−(d−1)k 1 G ∩ N ⊆ I n−dkN. Hence h = dk suffices. (4.9) Corollary. Let (R, m, k) be a local ring. Then every finitely generated module is syzygetically Artin-Rees with respect to every ideal in R. Proof. By Theorem 4.8, there exists an integer h such that if I is any ideal and if (F•, ∂•) is a free resolution of M, then I nFi ∩ ∂i+1(Fi+1) ⊆ In−h∂i+1(Fi+1) for i > d = dimR R. Once I is fixed, then there are also Artin-Rees numbers for the earlier syzygies, so the maximum of h and these numbers works for I and M. 14 I. ABERBACH, A. HOSRY, AND J. STRIULI A second corollary has to do with perturbations of resolutions. Let (R, m) be a local ring. A complex G′ • is a perturbation of G• to orders q1, q2, . . . if the free modules in each are the same and the difference of the nth differentials maps Gn to mqn Gn−1. Eisenbud and Huneke raise the following question (Question C in [6]): If G• is a minimal free resolution of the finitely generated module M, is there a number q such that any complex G′ • which is a perturbation of G• to order q, q, . . . is exact? (4.10) Corollary. Let (R, m) be a local ring of dimension d. Question C has an affirmative answer. Moreover, for the class of dth syzygy modules, the integer q may be chosen depending only on the ring. Proof. We refer the reader to Proposition 1.1 of [6] for details of how the syzygetic Artin-Rees property is connected to the perturbation question. References 1.
