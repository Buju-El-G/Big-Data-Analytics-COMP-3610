      "1 < p ≤ ∞. The primary motivation for studying this conjecture was that it is a natural strength\u0002ening of the minimum (von Neumann) output entropy conjecture, which is of fundamental im\u0002portance in quantum information theory. In particular, since the multiplicativity conjecture was\n",
      "formulated, most attempts to prove the minimum output entropy conjecture for special cases ac\u0002tually proved maximal p-norm multiplicativity and then took the limit as p decreases to 1. This\n",
      "strategy, we now know, cannot be used to prove the conjecture in general.\n",
      "From that perspective, it would seem that the results in this paper cast doubt on the validity\n",

      "of p-norm multiplicativity such as exact or approximate multiplicativity in a channel-dependent12\n",

      "Another strategy that is still open would be to approach the von Neumann minimum output\n",

      "on influencing a single eigenvalue of the output state of the tensor product channel; while here\n",

      "993  A Kempe swap in a proper coloring interchanges the colors on some maximal\\nconnected 2-colored subgraph. Two $k$-colorings are $k$-equivalent if we can\\ntransform one into the other using Kempe swaps. The triangulated toroidal grid,\\n$T[m\\times n]$, is formed from (a toroidal embedding of) the Cartesian product\\nof $C_m$ and $C_n$ by adding parallel diagonals inside all 4-faces. Mohar and\\nSalas showed that not all 4-colorings of $T[m\\times n]$ are 4-equivalent. In\\ncontrast, Bonamy, Bousquet, Feghali, and Johnson showed that all 6-colorings of\\n$T[m\\times n]$ are 6-equivalent. They asked whether the same is true for\\n5-colorings. We answer their question affirmatively when $m,n\\ge 6$. Further,\\nwe show that if $G$ is 6-regular with a toroidal embedding where every\\nnon-contractible cycle has length at least 7, then all 5-colorings of $G$ are\\n5-equivalent. Our results relate to the antiferromagnetic Pott's model in\\nstatistical mechanics.   \n",

Since p=1 corresponds to the\\nvon Neumann entropy, these counterexamples demonstrate that if the additivity\\nconjecture of quantum information theory is true, it cannot be proved as a\\nconsequence of any channel-independent guarantee of maximal p-norm\\nmultiplicativity.

Las Vergnas and Meyniel proved [11] (see Lemma 1)\\r\\n1We omit a formal definition of unique embedding; informally, it means that we can transform any embedding to any other\\r\\nby “sliding” the graph around the torus, keeping it embedded throughout this sliding process. If we consider the 6-regular triangulation of the plane,\\r\\nthe set of automorphisms that fix a given vertex v has size 12; it has 6-fold rotational symmetry, together\\r\\nwith reflection through a line containing v. The essential point is that our arguments do not make use of\\r\\nthe global structure of G, but only of subgraphs of G of diameter at most 6. If H is a subgraph of G with\\r\\ndiameter at most 4, then H is locally connected unless there exists a vertex w such that H contains at least\\r\\nfour neighbors of w but excludes w.\\r\\nFirst, suppose instead that there exists a vertex w such that H contains at least four neighbors of w, but\\r\\nexcludes w. By Pigeonhole, H contains some pair of non-adjacent vertices such that w is their only common\\r\\nneighbor. So most of the\\r\\nwork in proving our Main Theorem (as well as Theorem 1) goes to showing that if G is a 6-regular toroidal\\r\\ngraph with edge-width at least 7, then every 5-coloring of G is 5-equivalent to a coloring that contains a\\r\\nmonochromatic good template. To simulate in G an α/β swap at a vertex v in GT ,\\r\\nwe simply perform an α/β swap at each vertex in G that was identified to form v. (If v ∈ V (G), then this\\r\\nis a single swap; but if v represents some non-singleton color of T , then this may be multiple swaps.)  \n",
