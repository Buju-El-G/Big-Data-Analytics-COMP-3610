      "2.1 An Introduction to Good Templates Given a coloring ϕ of G, our idea is to identify the vertices in one or more independent sets, each of which receives a common color under ϕ. If the resulting graph is 4-degenerate, then all of its 5-colorings are 5equivalent, as shown in Lemma 1; and these 5-colorings correspond to some of the 5-colorings of G (precisely those 5-colorings of G where the vertices in each identified independent set receive a common color). A good 4-template good 4-template in G is an independent set T of size 4 such that identifying all vertices of T yields a 4-degenerate graph; see Figure 2. We show that if ϕ1 and ϕ2 are 5-colorings that each use a common color on some good 4-template, say T1 and T2, then ϕ1 and ϕ2 are 5-equivalent. We also show that every 5-coloring is 5-equivalent to a 5-coloring that uses a common color on the vertices of some good 4-template. Together, these two steps prove our Main Theorem. To formalize this approach, we introduce more terminology. A template template T in G is a collection of disjoint independent sets; each set in T is a color of T . A template color with a single color is monochromatic. A template T appears in a coloring ϕ of G if the vertices in each color appears of T receive a common color under ϕ. If T appears in ϕ, then also ϕ contains T . By contracting a template contains contracting a template T , we mean identifying the vertices in each color of T . When we contract template T in G, the resulting graph is denoted GT . A template T is good good for G if GT is 4-degenerate. We will see that every 6-regular toroidal graph G is vertex transitive. So if G has a single good template, then it has many of them. Thus, given a 5-coloring ϕ, our focus will be on finding a good 4-template contained in ϕ (or some 5-coloring that is Kempe 5-equivalent to ϕ). Good templates play a central role in our proof of the Main Theorem. This is due to the following three easy lemmas. The first was originally proved in [11]; but for completeness, we include the proof. The third, Lemma 3, holds in more generality, which we discuss in Section 4. Lemma 1. Let G be a graph with a vertex w such that d(w) < k. If all k-colorings of G−w are k-equivalent, then also all k-colorings of G are k-equivalent. Thus, if G is d-degenerate and d < k, then all k-colorings of G are k-equivalent. Proof. The second statement follows from the first by induction on |V (G)|, where the base case |V (G)| = holds trivially. Now we prove the first. Let w be a vertex with d(w) < k. Let G′:= G − w. Let ϕ1 and ϕ denote k-colorings of G and let ϕ ′ and ϕ ′ 2 denote their restrictions to G′ . By hypothesis, all k-colorings of G′ are k-equivalent. So there exists a sequence ψ ′ , . . . , ψ′ s of k-colorings of G′ such that ψ ′ 1 = ϕ ′ , ψ ′ s = ϕ ′ and each ψ ′ i+1 differs from ψ ′ i by only a single Kempe swap. We extend each ψ ′ i to a k-coloring ψi of G as follows. Let ψ1 = ϕ1. Suppose that ψ ′ i+1 differs from ψ ′ i by an α/β swap at a vertex vi . To construct ψi+ from ψi we use the same α/β swap at vi, unless w lies in the same α/β component as vi and has at least neighbors in that component. In that case, some color γ ∈ {1, . . . , k} is not used on the closed neighborhood 2For example, begin with the cartesian product of K3 and K2, drawn in the plane, and add a 4-vertex inside each 4-face. The resulting graph is 4-chromatic, but has two Kempe non-4-eqivalent 4-colorings. By gluing t copies of this graph along copies of K3, we form a graph with 2t 4-equivalence classes. By gluing carefully, we ensure that the resulting graph is planar. 3of w. Now we first recolor w with γ, and then use the α/β swap at vi . We call the resulting coloring ψi+1. By induction on i, each ψi restricts to ψ ′ i on G′. Thus, ψs agrees with ϕ2 on all vertices except for possibly w. If needed, recolor w with its color in ϕ2. Lemma 2. If T is a good template in a graph G, then all 5-colorings of G containing T are 5-equivalent. Proof. Form GT from G by contracting T . Note that each 5-coloring ϕ of G containing T corresponds to a 5-coloring ϕT of GT (formed by contracting T in ϕ). Since T is good, GT is 4-degenerate. By Lemma 1, all 5-colorings of GT are 5-equivalent. If η and ζ are 5-colorings of G containing T , then ηT and ζT are 5-equivalent colorings of GT . Further, this is witnessed by a sequence of Kempe swaps. This same sequence of Kempe swaps witnesses the 5-equivalence of η and ζ. To simulate in G an α/β swap at a vertex v in GT , we simply perform an α/β swap at each vertex in G that was identified to form v. (If v ∈ V (G), then this is a single swap; but if v represents some non-singleton color of T , then this may be multiple swaps.) Lemma 3. Let G be a 4-colorable graph. If ϕ1 and ϕ2 are 5-colorings of G that contain monochromatic good templates T1 and T2, then ϕ1 and ϕ2 are 5-equivalent. Proof. Let ϕ0 be a 4-coloring of G; for concreteness, assume that ϕ0 does not use green. Form ϕ ′ 1 and ϕ ′ from ϕ0 by recoloring the vertices of T1 and T2, respectively, with green. Now ϕ1 and ϕ ′ are 5-equivalent, by Lemma 2, since they both contain the good template T1. Similarly, ϕ2 and ϕ ′ are 5-equivalent. Finally, ϕ ′ 1 and ϕ ′ 2 are both 5-equivalent to ϕ0, since each is formed from ϕ0 by recoloring an independent set with green (and each such recoloring step is a valid Kempe swap). We will see that all 6-regular toroidal graphs with edge-width at least 7 are 4-colorable (with one exception, which we handle separately). This was proved by Yeh and Zhu [16], building on work of Collins and Hutchinson [7]. The latter also proved that T [a × b] is 4-colorable whenever a ≥ 6 and b ≥ 6. So most of the work in proving our Main Theorem (as well as Theorem 1) goes to showing that if G is a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 7, then every 5-coloring of G is 5-equivalent to a coloring that contains a monochromatic good template. That is the content of Section 3. In view of Lemmas 2 and 3, and ideas in the previous paragraph, we need a tool to prove that certain templates are good. A 4-degeneracy order 4-degenerof a graph G acy order is an order σ of V (G) such that each vertex in σ has at least d(v) − 4 neighbors that appear earlier in σ. A 4-degeneracy prefix 4-degeneracy prefixof a graph G is an order σ of some subset of V (G) such that each vertex in σ has at least d(v) − 4 neighbors that appear earlier in σ. A subgraph H of G is locally connected locally connected if each pair of vertices in H that is at distance two in G is also at distance two in H. A subgraph H of G is well-behaved wellbehavedif (i) it is locally connected and (ii) G − H is connected. Lemma 4. Let H be a well-behaved subgraph of G and let VH denote its vertex set. Let T be a template with all vertices in VH ; denote the new vertices in GT by VT . Suppose there exist v1, v2 ∈ VH \\ VT and there exist v3, v4 ∈ V (GT ) \\ VH such that v3 is a common neighbor of v1, v2 and that v4 is a common neighbor of v3, vi for some i ∈ {1, 2}. If there exists a 4-degeneracy prefix σ for VH \\ VT , then GT has a 4-degeneracy order, with all vertices of VT coming last in the degeneracy order. Proof. We will extend σ to all of V (GT ) \\ VH. Let R := ∅. We iteratively add vertices of V (GT ) \\ VH to R, so that at each step (i) G[R] is connected and (ii) σ can be extended to (VH \\VT )∪R. Since v1, v2 ∈ VH \\VT and v3 is their common neighbor, we can add v3 to R and append it to σ; similarly, we can add v4. Let S := V (GT ) \\ (VH ∪ R). Now suppose that S 6= ∅. Choose v ∈ R such that v has a neighbor in S. (This is possible since G − H is connected.) Denote the neighbors of v in cyclic order by w1, . . . , w6. Since G[R] is connected, and |R| ≥ 2, we can assume that w1 ∈ R and w6 ∈/ R. If w6 ∈ S, then we add w6 to R and append it to the prefix, since its neighbors v and w1 are already in R. So assume that w6 ∈ VH. Now w2 ∈/ VH, since w1, v /∈ VH and H is locally connected. If w2 ∈ S, then we add w2 to R, since its neighbors w1 and v are in R. So assume that w2 ∈ R. Note that w3 ∈/ VH, since H is locally connected and w6 ∈ VH but v /∈ VH. Again, if w3 ∈ S, then we add w3 to R; so assume that w3 ∈ R. If w4 ∈ S, then we add w4 to R, so assume that w4 ∈/ S. If w4 ∈ VH, then also w5 ∈ VH , since H is locally connected and w4, w6 ∈ VH . This contradicts 41 1 Figure 2: Two examples of good 4-templates in 6-regular toroidal graphs; each includes a triple centered at 1. In both examples, 2 and 3 serve as v1 and v2 in Lemma 4. It is easy to check that the subgraph induced by the four orange vertices and the three numbered vertices is locally connected; thus, it is well-behaved. our choice of v as having a neighbor in S. So w4 ∈/ VH, which implies that w4 ∈ R. Finally, w5 ∈ S since v has some neighbor in S, by our choice of v. Thus, we can always grow R and σ, as desired. To apply Lemma 4, we will want to verify that some subgraphs H are locally connected. This is fairly easy, but is complicated slightly by the presence of non-contractible cycles. So the following lemma is useful. Lemma 5. Let G be a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 7. If H is a subgraph of G with diameter at most 4, then H is locally connected unless there exists a vertex w such that H contains at least four neighbors of w but excludes w. First, suppose instead that there exists a vertex w such that H contains at least four neighbors of w, but excludes w. By Pigeonhole, H contains some pair of non-adjacent vertices such that w is their only common neighbor. So, H is not locally connected. Thus, the hypothesis on w in Lemma 5 is necessary. Proof. Suppose there exist w, x ∈ V (H) with dG(w, x) = 2 but dH(w, x) > 2. Denote the common neighbor(s) in G of w and x by y1 and y2 (if it exists). Since dH(w, x) > 2, we have y1, y2 ∈/ V (H). Since H has diameter at most four, a short case analysis shows that H contains at least four neighbors of either y1 or y2. (Since H has diameter at most 4, but G has edge-width at least 7, we can essentially ignore the possibility of non-contractible cycles creating problems.) Remark. Often when we claim, in later proofs, that a template is good, we will be implicitly using Lemmas and 5. A triple is an independent set of size 3 with a common neighbor. For example, in each picture in triple Figure 2 a triple comprises the three orange neighbors of vertex 1. A triple itself is not a good 4-template. However, each triple is a subset of 12 good 4-templates. These include the two good 4-templates shown in Figure 2, along with 10 others that arise by rotation and reflection. Further, we show in Lemma 10 that if ϕ contains a triple, then ϕ is 5-equivalent to some 5-coloring that contains a good 4-template. Because triples have fewer vertices than any good template, they are easier to work with. Thus, we aim to show that every 5-coloring is 5-equivalent to a 5-coloring containing a triple. This motivates the following lemma. Lemma 6. Let T be a good template for G, as witnessed by a subgraph H in Lemma 4. Let v /∈ VH be a vertex such that T ∪ {v} is also a good template, with v as its own color. For each 5-coloring ϕ0 of T and each α ∈ {1, . . . , 5} such that using α on v extends ϕ0 to a proper 5-coloring ϕ ′ 0 of T +v, there exists a proper 5-coloring of G that extends ϕ ′ . This v is called a bonus vertex bonus vertex for T . In particular, if there exists some other color C in T such that C ∪ {v} includes a triple, then every 5-coloring ϕ containing T is 5-equivalent to a 5-coloring containing a triple. Proof. For an example, see Figure 5, where T has the two colors {1, 2, 3, 4} and {6, 9}, H is induced by 1, . . . , 11 and v = 12. The hypothesis that v is its own color implies that v is not identified with any other vertex of T . Thus, v can appear last in the degeneracy order, and is not required to have the same color as any other vertex in T . Since T ∪ {v} is a good template, every proper 5-coloring of T ∪ {v}, that respects its colors, extends to a 5-coloring of G (we simply color the vertices outside T ∪ {v} in the reverse of the 54-degeneracy order). Fix a proper 5-coloring ϕ ′ of T ∪ {v}, and let ϕ be an extension of this coloring of T ∪ {v} to a 5-coloring of G. Let ϕ1 be any other 5-coloring of G that contains T . Since ϕ1 and ϕ both contain T , they are 5-equivalent. If C ∪ {v} includes a triple, then ϕ contains this triple, so ϕ1 is indeed 5-equivalent to a 5-coloring that contains a triple. 2.2 Shifted Triangulated Toroidal Grids We denote each vertex in a triangulated toroidal grid T [a×b] by an ordered pair (i, j) with i ∈ {1, . . . , a} and j ∈ {1, . . . , b}; vertices are numbered as entries of a matrix, with (1, 1) in the top left and (a, b) in the bottom right; see Figure 1. So (i, j) is adjacent to (i, j − 1),(i − 1, j),(i − 1, j + 1),(i, j + 1),(i + 1, j),(i + 1, j − 1) with arithmetic modulo a and b, as appropriate. Let T [a × b, c] denote a triangulated a × b toroidal grid with shift c triangulated a × b toroidal grid with shift c . The vertex set is the same as that for T [a × b], and the edge set is the same except that edges from column b to column 1 are \"shifted\" by c. More precisely, each vertex (i, b) is adjacent to (i + c − 2, 1),(i + c − 1, 1),(i + 1, b),(i + 1, b − 1),(i, b − 1),(i − 1, b). So T [a × b] = T [a × b, 1]. The following useful result3characterizes all 6-regular toroidal graphs. Theorem 2 ([1, 15]). Every 6-regular toroidal graph has the form T [a×b, c] for some positive integers a, b, c with c ≤ a. This is Theorem 3.4 in [15]; the condition c ≤ a draws on the comment in [15] at the bottom of page 169. A circulant Cn[1, r, r + 1] circulant Cn[1, r, r + 1] is a 6-regular graph4 with vertex set {1, . . . , n} and with i and j adjacent if i − j ∈ {±1, ±r, ±(r + 1)}. Each circulant Cn[1, r, r + 1] has a natural embedding as a triangulation of the torus: begin with the hamiltonian cycle consisting of edges of \"length\" 1, wrapping around the torus in one direction, and now embed the remaining edges, each wrapping around the torus in the other direction. Building on work of Collins and Hutchinson [7], Yeh and Zhu [16] proved the following. Theorem 3 ([16, 7]). All 6-regular toroidal graphs are 4-colorable, with the following exceptions: 1. G ∈ {T [3 × 3, 2], T [3 × 3, 3], T [5 × 3, 2], T [5 × 3, 3], T [5 × 5, 3], T [5 × 5, 4]}. 2. G = T [m × 2, 1] with m odd. 3. G = Cn[1, r, r + 1] and n ∈ {2r + 2, 2r + 3, 3r + 1, 3r + 2} and n is not divisible by 4. 4. G = Cn[1, 2, 3] and n is not divisible by 4. 5. G = Cn[1, r, r + 1] and (r, n) ∈ {(3, 13),(3, 17),(3, 18),(3, 25),(4, 17),(6, 17),(6, 25),(6, 33),(7, 19), (7, 25), (7, 26),(9, 25),(10, 25),(10, 26),(10, 37),(14, 33)}. It is easy to prove that the graphs in Theorem 3 are not 4-colorable. More specifically, if α(G) denotes the indpendence number of G, then simple arguments show that each of the graphs in parts (1–4) have α(G) < |G|/4, and thus, χ(G) ≥ |G|/α(G) > 4; details are given in Section 3 of [16]. (The proof for graphs in (5) is ad hoc.) Thus, the result in Theorem 3 is best possible. Lemma 7. If G is a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 6, and G /∈ {C26[1, 10, 11], C37[1, 10, 11]}, then G is 4-colorable. Proof. This is an easy consequence of Theorem 3. Each graph in (1), (2), (3), and (4) has edge width at most 5, 3, 3, and 3 (respectively). So we only consider graphs in (5). Note that Cn[1, r, r + 1] always has edge-width at most r+ 1. So we assume that r ≥ 6. When (r, n) = (6, 17), we have the non-contractible cycle with successive edge lengths 6, 6, 6, −1. When (r, n) = (6, 25), we have 6, 6, 6, 7. When (r, n) = (6, 33), we have 6, 6, 7, 7, 7. When (r, n) = (7, 19), we have 7, 7, 7, −1, −1. When (r, n) = (7, 25), we have 8, 8, 8, 1. When (r, n) = (7, 26), we have 8, 8, 8, 1, 1. When (r, n) = (9, 25), we have 9, 9, 9, −1, −1. When (r, n) = (10, 25), we have 11, 11, 1, 1, 1. When (r, n) = (14, 33), we have 15, 15, 1, 1, 1. 3This characterization was stated by Altshuler [1], but his paper did not give a complete proof. About 10 years later, Negami published a proof [15], apparently unaware of the work of Altshuler. 4When n ∈ {2r, 2r + 1, 2r + 2} it is actually a 6-regular multigraph. 6Lemma 8. Let G be a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 7. If ϕ1 and ϕ2 are 5-colorings of G and each contains some good monochromatic template (possibly different templates in ϕ1 and ϕ2), then ϕ and ϕ2 are 5-equivalent. Proof. When G is 4-colorable, the result follows from Lemma 3. So, by Lemma 7, we only need to consider G ∈ {C26[1, 10, 11], C37[1, 10, 11]}. Further, C26[1, 10, 11] has a non-contractible cycle of length 6; it has edge lengths 11, 11, 1, 1, 1, 1. So assume that G = C37[1, 10, 11]. Let ϕ0 denote the 5-coloring of G that uses color i mod 4 on vertex i, for each i < 37, and uses a fifth color on vertex 37, call it green. An s-rotation of ϕ uses green on vertex s and uses color i mod 4 on vertex i + s, for each i < 37; a rotation is an s-rotation for rotation some value of s. If T1 is a 4-template, then some rotation ϕ s of ϕ0 uses green only on a vertex that is not in ∪v∈T1N[v], since |T1| ∗ 7 = 28 < 37; in fact, there exist at least 37 − 28 = 9 of these. So there exists a 5-coloring ϕ1,s of G that agrees with ϕ s 0 outside of T1 and uses green on T1; again, there are at least 9 of these. By Lemma 2, we know that all of these 5-colorings containing T1 are 5-equivalent; further, from each of them, we can recolor the vertices of T1 to reach ϕ s . By the transitivity of equivalence, and the fact that G is vertex transitive, every 5-coloring containing T1 is 5-equivalent to every rotation of ϕ0. The same is true of 5-colorings containing T2. Thus, ϕ1 and ϕ2 are 5-equivalent. Now we prove the Main Theorem, assuming results in Section 3. For reference, we restate it. Main Theorem. If G is a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 7, then all 5-colorings of G are 5-equivalent. Proof. Let G be a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 7. In Lemma 16 of Section 3 we prove that every 5-coloring of G is 5-equivalent to a 5-coloring that contains a good 4-template. Now Lemma proves that all 5-colorings of G are 5-equivalent. An event E(n) happens asymptotically almost surely if Pr(E(n)) → 1 as n → ∞. Lemma 9. Fix a positive integer g. If G is a 6-regular toroidal graph on n vertices chosen uniformly at random, then asymptotically almost surely the edge-width of G is at least g. Proof. Fix a positive integer n. We prove an upper bound on the fraction of 6-regular toroidal n-vertex graphs that have edge-width less than g, and we show that this fraction tend to 0 as n tends to infinity. Claim 1. Each 6-regular toroidal graph can be written as T [a×b, c] for at most 6 choices of positive integers (a, b, c), such that c ≤ a. Claim 1 follows immediately from Corollary 3.7 of [15]. The idea of that proof is to start from a vertex and follow edges along a \"straight line\" until returning to that vertex. More formally, to follow a straight line, the successor of each vertex v is 3 later than its predecessor in the cyclic order of neighbors of v. The factor 6 in Claim 1 arises from the 6 choices of neighbors to leave our initial vertex. (Since each graph T [a × b, c] is vertex-transitive, our choice of initial vertex has no effect.) Claim 2. There exists a constant Cg such that, for all positive integers a and b, at most Cg graphs of the form T [a × b, c] (with c ≤ a) have edge-width less than g. Fix positive integers a and b. We bound (independently of a and b) the number of integers c with 1 ≤ c ≤ a such that T [a × b, c] has edge-width less than g. We make no effort to optimize this bound, only to show that it is independent of a and b. Suppose that T [a × b, c] has a non-contractible cycle C of length less than g. Let r denote the number of number of times that C wraps around the torus in the direction of the dimension of length a. Let s denote the number of edges on C of length 1 in this direction, and let t and t2 denote the numbers of edges on C from column b to column 1 of lengths c and c + 1, respectively. More precisely, let s, t1, t2 denote the net numbers of these edges traversed in the positive direction as we traverse C (for some arbitrary orientation). So s + ct1 + (c + 1)t2 = ra. Thus, c = (ra − s − t2)/(t1 + t2). Since s, t1, t2, and r are all bounded in terms of g (e.g. g > s + t1 + t2 > −g and g + 1 ≥ r ≥ −(g + 1)), so is the number of choices for c. This proves the claim. 7Let d(n) denote the number of divisors of n. To build a 6-regular toroidal graph T [a × b, c] on n vertices, we have d(n) choices for the pair (a, b). So the number of 6-regular toroidal graphs with edge-width less than g is at most d(n)Cg, by Claim 2. The number of 6-regular toroidal graphs for the pair (a, b) is precisely a, since 1 ≤ c ≤ a. So the number for the pairs (a, b) and (b, a) is a + b ≥ max(a, b) ≥ √ n. By Claim 1, this overcounts the total number of 6-regular toroidal graphs on n vertices by a factor of at most 6. Thus, the fraction of 6-regular toroidal graphs on n vertices with edge-width less than g is at most d(n)Cg/(((d(n)/2)√ n)/6) = 12Cg/ √ n, which tends to 0 as n tends to infinity. This theorem and lemma immediately imply the following corollary. Main Corollary. If G is a 6-regular toroidal graph on n vertices chosen uniformly at random, then asymptotically almost surely all 5-colorings of G are 5-equivalent. 3 Good Templates Throughout this section we assume that G is a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 7. A coloring ϕ of G is nice if it is 5-equivalent to some coloring that contains a good 4-template. In this section nice we prove that every 5-coloring ϕ of G is nice. Our proof uses a sequence of lemmas, with increasingly weaker hypotheses, culminating in the desired result. We adopt conventions common to all figures in this section. We generally number vertices in the order that we determine their colors. Sometimes, we do not determine the color of a vertex, but rather determine a color not used there. For such vertices, we restart the numbering, using higher numbers. To denote that a vertex is not colored green, we lightly shade it green. We often argue by symmetry. For example, we assume that any triple centered at 30 in Figure 3 is {1, 2, 3}, rather than {28, 31, 32}. It is possible that the only automorphism of G that fixes vertex is the identity map. So we do not quite mean that we can apply the same argument to G under some automorphism. But we do mean something close. If we consider the 6-regular triangulation of the plane, the set of automorphisms that fix a given vertex v has size 12; it has 6-fold rotational symmetry, together with reflection through a line containing v. The essential point is that our arguments do not make use of the global structure of G, but only of subgraphs of G of diameter at most 6. Each time that we invoke symmetry, we appeal to a map from one such subgraph to another, typically with many vertices in common. And we always mean one of these 12 symmetries mentioned above. To highlight these symmetries, we draw our pictures as subgraphs of the 6-regular triangulation of the plane. However, a moment's reflection shows that these are isomorphic to subgraphs of a triangulated toroidal grid (as it is drawn in Figure 1). Along similar lines, it is possible that two vertices drawn as distinct in some figure are in fact the same vertex, when G has a short non-contractible cycle. Such a pair must be drawn at distance at least 7. Similarly, vertices may be joined by an edge that is not shown; but such vertices must be drawn at distance at least 6. In some figures, the subgraph shown may have diameter 7 or more. However, the attentive reader will note that whenever we conclude that ϕ contains a good template T , the vertices of T are contained in some subgraph H with diameter at most 4. Thus, we avoid these potential complications. Lemma 10. If a 5-coloring ϕ of G contains a triple, then ϕ is nice. Proof. Assume the lemma is false, and let ϕ be a counterexample with a triple centered at 30, as in Figure 3. (1-3) By symmetry, assume 1, 2, 3 are orange. Neither 6 nor 7 is orange; otherwise {1, 2, 3, 6} or {1, 2, 3, 7} is a good template. By symmetry, none of the following are orange: 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22. (4) We will show that 8 is not orange; suppose instead that it is. If 23 or 24 is orange, then ϕ has a good orange template at {1, 2, 8, w}, where w ∈ {23, 24}. So neither 23 nor 24 is orange; similarly, neither 25 nor 26 is orange. Let α denote the color of 7. If neither 28 nor 29 is α, then an α/orange swap at 7,8 makes orange (and does not change the color anywhere else except 8, and possibly 9). This gives a good template at {1, 2, 3, 7}, which shows that 8 is not orange. So it suffices to ensure that neither 28 nor 29 is α. First suppose that 28 is α. If 27, 29, and 30 do not have distinct colors, then some color β is absent from the closed neighborhood of 28, so we use an α/β swap at 28, ensuring that neither 28 nor 29 is α. Thus, 8we assume that 27, 29, and 30 have distinct colors. If 28, 31, 32 have distinct colors, then let γ denote the color on 30. Now an α/γ swap at 28,30 reduces to the case where 28 (and also 29) is not color α, handled above. So assume that 28, 31, 32 do not have distinct colors. Thus, some color is absent from the closed neighborhood of 30. Now recoloring 30 ensures that 30 has the same color as 27 or 29, which we have handled above. Thus, we assume that 28 is not α. 4 23 28 31 6 8 14 16 Figure 3: The proof of Lemma 10. Suppose instead that 29 is α. By symmetry, we can assume that 9 and 27 are both some color β; otherwise, we reflect across the line through 8 and 28. Now we will recolor 8 so that it is not orange. If 28 and 4 have a common color, then some color is unused on the closed neighborhood of 8, so we can recolor 8. So assume that 28 and 4 use distinct colors; let γ be the color on 28. If 30 is α or β, then some color is unused on the closed neighborhood of 28, so we can recolor 28 using the color on 4. This allows us to recolor 8, which ensures that neither 8 nor 4 is orange. Now we can recolor 7 orange, reducing to a case above. So assume that 30 is neither α nor β. If γ does not appear on {31, 32}, then we swap colors on 28 and and recolor 8 with γ. So assume that γ appears on {31, 32}. Now some color is unused on the closed neighborhood of 30, so we can recolor 30, ensuring that it uses either α or β; this reduces to a case above. Thus, we assume that 29 is not α. All of this shows that we can assume that 8 is not orange. By symmetry, neither 14 nor 20 is orange. So 4 is orange; otherwise we recolor 8 with orange and reduce to a previous case. By symmetry, assume that green does not appear on the unique common neighbor of any of the sets of vertices {1, 5}, {2, 11}, {3, 17}. We use green/orange swaps at each green/orange component containing vertices 1, 2, and 3. In the resulting coloring, 1, 2, and 3 are green but 4 is orange. So either one of 7, 8, or 9 is green or we can recolor 8 with green. For each possibility, we reduce to an earlier case. Let parallel pairs parallel pairs denote the template, with two colors and two vertices in each color, induced by vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} in Figure 4. Lemma 11. If a 5-coloring ϕ of G contains parallel pairs, then ϕ is nice. Proof. Assume the lemma is false, and let ϕ be a counterexample. By Lemma 10, it suffices to show that ϕ is equivalent to a 5-coloring that contains a triple. We assume 1,2 are green and 3,4 are blue, as in Figure 4. (5-7) Note that 5 must be green, as follows. If some other neighbor v of 19 is green, then ϕ contains a good template at {v, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The 4-degeneracy prefix begins 20, 14 and the bonus vertex is 15 (which we make green). If 19 has no green neighbor, then we can recolor 19 green and get a green triple at {1, 2, 19}. So 5 is green, as claimed. By the same argument, 6 is blue. If 10 is green, then ϕ contains a good template at {1, 2, 3, 4, 10}, with prefix 20, 14, 21 and bonus vertex 15. So 10 is not green; by symmetry, neither is 11. Similarly, neither 12 nor 13 is blue. Suppose that none of 7, 8, 16, and 25 is green or blue. Now we use green/blue swaps at 1,3 and at 2,4. Each of these green/blue components that we recolored contains at most 4 vertices; in particular, neither contains 5, so 5 is still green. If 19 is blue, then we have a blue triple centered at 14. If a neighbor v of 19 other than 5 is blue, then we have a good template {v, 1, 2, 3, 4}, as above (with 15 as bonus vertex). Otherwise, we can recolor 19 blue to get a blue triple centered at 14. Thus, we assume that at least one of 7, 8, 16, and 25 is blue or green. By symmetry, assume that 7 is blue. 9(8) Note that 14 is not blue, since then we have a blue triple at {3, 4, 14}. Similarly, 15 is not green. Suppose, to reach a contradiction, that 16 is blue. Let α be a color that is not green and not blue and that does not appear on 23 or 24. We use an α/green swap at 1 and an α/green swap at 2 (possibly a single swap, if 1 and 2 are in the same α/green component). It is easy to check that 1 and 2 are the only green vertices that get recolored α. In particular, 5 is still green. If a neighbor v of 19 is α, then we have a good template at {v, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Otherwise, either 19 is α or we can recolor it α. In each case, we get an α triple at {1, 2, 19}. Thus, 16 is not blue. So 8 must be green. Otherwise, the blue/green component containing 2,4 has at most two more vertices: 21 and 22. After a blue/green swap at 2,4, we can recolor 21 green. This gives a good template at {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 21}, with bonus vertex 15. Thus, 8 is green. 5 19 21 24 14 16 17 Figure 4: The proof of Lemma 11. (9) Note that 17 is not green (or blue, as we will see); otherwise, it would form a green triple with and 8. Suppose that 9 is not green. Let α be a color that is not green or blue and is also not used on or 24. Now we use a green/α swap at 1 and also use a green/α swap at 2. It is easy to check that the only green vertices that get uncolored are 1 and 2. In particular, 5 is still green. If a neighbor v of 19 is colored α, then we have a good template at {v, 1, 2, 3, 4}, with bonus vertex 15. So either 19 is α or we can recolor it α. In either case, we get a triple colored α. Thus, 9 is green. If 17 is blue, then we have a good template at {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 17}, with bonus vertex 15; the degeneracy prefix is 23, 16, 20, 14, 21. So 17 is not blue. Similarly, 18 is not blue; this good template replaces 17 in the previous one with 18, and the degeneracy prefix is 23, 16, 17, 20, 14, 21. Let β be a color that is not green or blue and is unused on 24 and 25. We use β/blue swaps at 3 and at 4. It is easy to check that the only blue vertices that get uncolored are 3 and 4. This new coloring again satisfies the hypotheses of the lemma, but 3 and 4 have a common color β different from the color on 6. We repeat our argument above that showed that 6 was blue. Now it shows that 6 is β, but in fact 6 is blue. This contradiction finishes the proof. Lemma 12. If a 5-coloring ϕ of G uses the same color on vertices 1, 2, 3, 4 in Figure 5, then ϕ is nice. 6 8 Figure 5: The proof of Lemma 12. Proof. By symmetry, assume that 1, 2, 3, 4 are orange. By Pigeonhole, some color other than orange is used on at least two neighbors of 5; call this color blue. If these neighbors are 6 and 7, then ϕ contains parallel pairs centered at 5, so we are done by Lemma 11. Thus, we assume that blue is used on vertices 9 and v, where v ∈ {6, 7, 8}. If v = 8, then we have the good template {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}; the prefix is 5, 7, 10, 11, and the bonus vertex is 12. If v = 6, then we have the good template {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}; the prefix is 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 and the bonus vertex is 12. It is easy to check that the subgraphs induced by {1, . . . , 11} and {1, . . . , 12} are well-behaved, since each of them has diameter 4, but every non-contractible cycle has length at least 7. So we assume that blue is used on 7 and 9. Repeating the same argument, with 10 in place of 5, shows that blue is used on 7 and 13. But now {7, 9, 13} is a blue triple, so ϕ is nice. 10Let crossing pairs crossing pairs denote the template, with two colors and two vertices in each color, induced by vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} in Figure 6. Lemma 13. If a 5-coloring ϕ of G contains crossing pairs, then ϕ is nice. Proof. We assume the lemma is false, and let ϕ be a counterexample. Further, we assume that 1 is blue, 2 is red, 3 is blue, and 4 is red. We may also assume that 5 is green, 6 is orange, and 7 is purple. By symmetry between red and blue, either 8 is green or 8 is blue. Case 1: 8 is green. Note that 9 is not red, or we have red/green parallel pairs centered at 7. Similarly, 11 is not blue. Neither 10 nor 12 is green, since ϕ has no green triple. So 9 and 10 are orange and blue (in some order), and 11 and 12 are red and purple (in some order). 2 5 6 8 14 15 16 Figure 6: Case 1.1: 9 is orange and 10 is blue. Case 1.1: 9 is orange, 10 is blue. (By horizontal symmetry, and permuting colors, this also includes the case that 9 is blue and 10 is orange, but 11 is purple and 12 is red.) None of 13, 14, 15 is orange; otherwise we have an orange triple centered at 8 (when 15 is orange) or we have a good template. When 13 is orange, the template is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13}, the prefix is 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, and the bonus vertex is the neighbor of 2 that forms a triple with 1 and 3. When 14 is orange, the template is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14} (with 12 in its own color class) the prefix is 5, 7, 8, 11; and the bonus vertex5is the neighbor w of 12 and 1 other than 6. After we color w orange, we are done by Lemma 12. If 11 is red and 12 is purple, then a red/orange swap at 11,6 gives a red triple centered at 5. So 11 is purple and 12 is red. By horizontal symmetry, none of 16, 17, 18 is purple. One of 19 and 20 is purple; otherwise a purple/blue swap at 7,10 gives a blue triple centered at 5. Similarly, one of 19 and 20 is orange; otherwise we use a purple/orange swap at 11,6,7,9 followed by a blue/orange swap at 10,7, which gives a blue triple centered at 5. So 19 and 20 are purple and orange (in some order). Now either we have purple/orange parallel pairs centered at 10, or we get them after a purple/orange swap at 11,6,7,9. This contradicts Lemma 11. 2 5 6 8 13 16 Figure 7: Case 1.2: 9 is blue, 10 is orange, 11 is red, 12 is purple. Case 1.2: 9 is blue, 10 is orange, 11 is red, 12 is purple. One of 13 and 14 is orange; otherwise a green/orange swap at 5,6,8 gives an orange triple centered at 7. Similarly, one of 13 and 14 is purple; otherwise, a purple/green swap at 5,7,8 gives a purple triple centered at 6. By Lemma 11, ϕ has no parallel pairs, so 13 is purple and 14 is orange. If neither 15 nor 16 is orange, then an orange/red swap at 6,11 gives a red triple centered at 5. If neither 15 nor 16 is blue, then we recolor 11 blue, and recolor 6 red, which gives a red triple centered at 6. So 15 and 16 are orange and blue (in some order). By symmetry, 17 and 18 are purple and red (in some order). Now we use a blue/green swap at 8,9, recolor 11 green, and recolor 6 red; this gives a red triple centered at 5. Case 2: 8 is blue. Now 9 is not red; otherwise, we have a good template at {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}, with prefix 5,7, and the bonus vertex is the neighbor of 2 that forms a triple with 1 and 3. So 9 is either orange or green. 5We must include 12 in the first template; otherwise, adding the bonus vertex w creates a subgraph that is not locally connected, since dG(11, w) = 2, but dH+w(11, w) > 2. 11Case 2.1: 9 is orange. (10-12) If 10 is green, then we have green/orange parallel pairs centered at 7. So 10 is blue. None of 15, 16, 17 is orange; otherwise we have an orange triple centered at 8 or a good template as in Case 1. (If v = 15, then our bonus vertex gives a blue triple. But if v = 16, then we use Lemma 12, as in Case 1.) 2 5 6 8 16 17 18 Figure 8: Case 2.1: 9 is orange. If 11 is red, then a red/orange swap at 11,6 gives a red triple centered at 5. So 12 is red; otherwise, we recolor 6 red, getting a red triple centered at 5. And 11 is green or purple. Assume 11 is purple; otherwise, a green/purple swap at 5,7 reduces to this case (with green and purple interchanged). Similar to 15, 16, 17, none of 18, 19, 20 is purple. (13-14) Now 13 or 14 is orange; otherwise an orange/red swap at 12,6 gives a red triple centered at 5. Also, 13 or 14 is purple; otherwise a purple/orange swap at 11,6,7,9, followed by a red/purple swap at 12,6, again gives a red triple centered at 5. So 13 and are orange and purple (in some order). But now we either have orange/purple parallel pairs centered at 12, or else we get them after a purple/orange swap at 11,6,7,9. Case 2.2: 9 is green. (11-12) Now 11 or 12 is red; otherwise, we recolor 6 red and get a red triple centered at 5. And 11 or 12 is green; otherwise a green/orange swap at 5,6 reduces to case 2.1, with green and orange interchanged. Note that 10 is either blue or orange. 2 5 6 8 9 19 18 Figure 9: Case 2.2a: 10 is blue. Case 2.2a: 10 is blue. (13-16) One of 13 and 14 is purple; otherwise we use a purple/red swap at 7,4, and recolor 6 purple, which gives purple/blue parallel pairs centered at 5. Similarly, one of 13 and 14 is orange; otherwise, a purple/orange swap at 6, reduces to the previous sentence. So 13 and 14 are purple and orange in some order. We assume 13 is orange and 14 is purple; otherwise a purple/orange swap at 6,7 reduces to this case. If 15 is green, then we have green/purple parallel pairs centered at 10. And if 15 is red, then we have the good template {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15}; the prefix is 5, 6, 7, and the bonus vertex is the neighbor of 3 that forms a triple with 2 and 4. So 15 is orange. Now 16 is red; otherwise we have a purple triple centered at 10. (17-19) Since we have no blue triple, 17 is purple or orange. If 18 is red, then we have red/blue parallel pairs centered at 9. Thus, 18 is purple or orange. If 19 is purple or orange, then we either have orange/purple parallel pairs centered at 8, or we get them after an orange/purple swap at 6,7. Thus, 19 is red or green. (20-21) We show that 20 and 21 are both purple or orange. Suppose 11 is red. If neither 20 nor is orange, then a red/orange swap at 11,6 gives a red triple centered at 5. If neither 20 nor 21 is purple, then a purple/orange swap at 6,7 followed by a red/purple swap at 11,6 again gives a red triple centered at 5. Instead, assume 11 is green. If neither 20 nor 21 is orange, then an orange/green swap at 11,6,5 gives orange/purple parallel pairs centered at 4. And if neither 20 nor 21 is purple, then we use a purple/orange swap at 6,7, followed by a green/purple swap at 11,6,5, followed by a purple/orange swap at 5,7; this again gives orange/purple parallel pairs centered at 4. So 20 and 21 are orange and purple. If 11 is green, then a green/blue swap at 11,8,9,10 gives a green triple centered at 7. So assume 11 is red, and use a red/blue swap at 11,8. If 18 is purple, then a red/orange swap at 8,6 gives a red triple centered at 5; so assume 18 is orange. Now a purple/orange swap at 6,7 and a purple/red swap at 8,6 again gives a red triple centered at 5. 12Case 2.2b: 10 is orange. (13-14) Note that 13 or 18 is purple; otherwise, we use a purple/red swap at 7,4 and recolor 6 purple, which gives purple/blue parallel pairs centered at 5. Suppose that 18 is purple. Now 13 is not green; otherwise we have green/purple parallel pairs centered at 4. So 13 is orange. Now we reduce to Case 1 with 13, 18, 10, 7, in place of 1, 2, 3, 4 (and orange, purple, red in place of blue, red, green). Thus, 13 is purple. If 19 is red, then we have the good template {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 19}; the prefix is 5, 6, 7, 10 and the bonus vertex is the neighbor of 3 that forms a triple with 2 and 4. So 19 is not red. Thus, is red; otherwise a red/orange swap at 4,10 gives orange/blue parallel pairs centered at 5. 2 5 6 11 8 16 17 12 Figure 10: Case 2.2b: 10 is orange. (15-17) If 15 is orange, then we have the good template {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 15}, with prefix 5, 7, 9. Our bonus vertex is 13, which allows us to finish by Lemma 12. Suppose is blue. If 19 is not purple, then a purple/orange swap at 6,7,10 and a red/orange swap at 4,7 gives red/blue parallel pairs centered at 9. So assume 19 is purple. Now 18 is blue; otherwise we recolor 10 blue and get a blue triple centered at 9. Now 17 is orange; otherwise an orange/green swap at 10,9 gives parallel orange/green pairs centered at 7. Finally, a green/purple swap at 5,7,9 and a red/green swap at 4,7 gives red/blue parallel pairs centered at 9. Thus, 15 is not blue. So 15 is purple, since it sees red and green and is not orange or blue. Thus, 16 is purple; otherwise a purple/blue swap at 7,8 gives a blue triple centered at 5. If 11 is red and 12 is green, then a green/blue swap at 8,9 gives a green triple centered at 6. So 11 is green and 12 is red. If 17 is orange, then we recolor 8 red and recolor 7 blue, which gives a blue triple centered at 5. So 17 is red. (18-19) Now 18 or 19 is green; otherwise a green/orange swap at 9,10 gives green/orange parallel pairs centered at 7. And 18 or 19 is blue; otherwise we recolor 10 blue, which gives blue/red parallel pairs centered at 9. So 18 and 19 are blue and green (in some order). Now we use a purple/orange swap at 6, 7, 10 followed by a red orange swap at 4, 7. This gives a red triple centered at 9. Let a pair denote the template, with one color and two vertices, induced by vertices {1, 3} in Figure 10. pair Lemma 14. Every 5-coloring of G is equivalent to a 5-coloring with a pair. Proof. Six vertices in a coloring form alternating sets alternating sets if they are colored as vertices 1,2,3,4,5,6 in Figure (not Figure 11), ignoring all other colors in that picture. We first show that each 5-coloring is equivalent to a 5-coloring that contains either a pair or alternating sets. Assume instead that ϕ is a counterexample to this statement. 7 13 Figure 11: A claim in the proof of Lemma 14. (1-6) Since we have no pair, we also have no triple. By Pigeonhole, two colors appear exactly twice on the neighborhood of 7. Since we have no pair, these repeated colors appear \"across\" from each other; that is, each color appears on two vertices with 7 as their unique common neighbor. By rotational symmetry, we assume 1 and are red, and 3 and 4 are orange, as in Figure 11. If no neighbor of 3 is red, and no neighbor of 1 is orange, then an orange/red swap at 1,3 gives orange on both 1 and 4, a pair. Thus, either 5 is red or 9 is orange; by symmetry, we assume that 5 is red. By repeating the same argument for 2 and 4, we assume that 6 is red; if instead 11 is orange, then we have alternating sets, as claimed. (7-14) Now 7 and 8 are new colors, green and blue, respectively. If 9 is orange, then we have alternating sets; and if 9 is green, then we have a green pair, 9 and 7. If 9 is purple, then we recolor 7 with purple and get a purple pair. So 9 is blue. This implies that 10 is purple. Clearly, 11 is not red or blue. It is 13also not green, since ϕ has no pair, and it is not orange, since ϕ does not have alternating sets. So 11 is purple. If 12 is green or purple, then ϕ contains a pair; so 12 is blue. Now 13 and 14 are both green; for each vertex, three colors appear on its neighbors and a fourth is forbidden, since ϕ contains no pair. Now we use a purple/orange swap at 10,4. This gives an orange pair at 10 and 3. This proves the claim that ϕ is equivalent to a 5-coloring that contains either a pair or alternating sets. 9 7 8 11 13 Figure 12: Finishing the proof of Lemma 14. (1-10) Now we assume that ϕ contains alternating sets, with 1, 4, 5 red and with 2, 3, 6 orange, as in Figure 12. We also assume 7 is green and 8 is blue. (a) First suppose that 9 and 10 are both purple. At least one of and 12 is blue or green. So either ϕ contains as a pair one of {7, 11} or {8, 12} or the resulting coloring contains one of these pairs after a green/blue swap at 7,8. So assume that 9 and 10 are not both purple. (b) Next suppose that 9 is blue and 10 is green. If none of 11, 12, 13, 14 is purple, then we recolor both 3 and 4 purple, which gives a pair. If instead one of 11, 12, 13, 14 is purple, then recoloring 7 or 8 purple gives a purple pair. Thus, we assume that exactly one of 9 and 10 is purple. (c) By reflectional symmetry, we assume that 9 is blue and 10 is purple. (11-18) Since 7 is green, 11 is not green. Similarly, is not purple, since then we can recolor 7 purple. So 11 is blue. If 12 is green, then we can recolor 7 purple and recolor 8 green. So 12 is purple. By reflectional symmetry, 13 is blue and also 14 is purple. Note that 15 is not green, since 7 is green. And 15 is not purple, since then we could recolor 7 purple to get a purple pair. So 15 is red. Similarly, 16 is orange. Next, 17 is green; otherwise, an orange/green swap at 2,7,3 gives the orange pair {6, 7}. Now recoloring 2 purple gives a purple pair at {2, 12}. Lemma 15. If ϕ is a 5-coloring of G with a pair, then ϕ is equivalent to a coloring that contains either a triple, or parallel pairs, or crossing pairs. In particular, ϕ is nice. Proof. The second statement follows immediately from the first, combined with Lemmas 10, 11, and 13. So we now prove the first; instead assume that ϕ is a counterexample. (1-8) By assumption, 1 and 2 have a common color, red; see Figure 13. Now 3 and 4 have new colors: purple and green, respectively. Further, 5 is also purple. Suppose instead that 5 is orange; now each of 7 and 8 is either purple or blue. If either is purple, then we have red/purple crossing pairs centered at 4. Otherwise, both 7 and 8 are blue, so we have red/blue parallel pairs centered at 4. Thus, we assume that 5 is purple; similarly, we assume that 6 is green. Below we frequently use this argument implicitly. Finally, 7 and 8 have new colors; if they are not distinct, then we have parallel pairs centered at 4. So assume 7 is orange and 8 is blue. Now we consider 4 cases, depending on the color of 9. 6 3 4 Figure 13: Case 1: 9 is orange. Case 1: 9 is orange. (10-13) Since 7 and 9 are both orange, 10 is red, like 1, and 11 is purple, like 3. Now 12 is blue. And 13 is orange; otherwise, a purple/orange swap at 3 gives an orange triple centered at 1. (14-16) One of 14 and 15 is blue; otherwise a blue/orange swap at 7 gives blue/red parallel pairs centered at 4. And one of of 14 and 15 is green; otherwise, an orange/green swap at 7,4 gives orange/red crossing pairs centered at 3. Note that 17 is not red, since 1 is red and 6 and 9 have distinct colors. So 16 is red; otherwise a red/orange swap at 9,1,7 gives a red triple centered at 11. (17-19) Note that 18 cannot be purple, since 3 is purple, but 6 and 9 have distinct colors. So 17 is purple; otherwise, a blue/purple swap at 12,3 gives blue/red crossing 14pairs centered at 4. Further, 18 cannot be orange, since then a red/blue swap at 12,1 gives red/orange crossing pairs centered at 17. So 18 is red. If 19 is green, then an orange/blue swap at 9,12 gives orange/red parallel pairs centered at 3. So 19 is blue. But now we recolor 9 with green, and recolor 12 with orange. This also gives orange/red parallel pairs centered at 3. 6 3 4 9 12 17 18 19 Figure 14: Case 2: 9 is purple. Case 2: 9 is purple. (10-14) If 10 is green, then we have green/purple parallel pairs centered at 1, so is blue. Since 3 and 9 are purple, 11 is orange and is red. If 13 is green, then we have green/purple parallel pairs centered at 11; so 13 is blue. If 14 is orange, then we have orange/red parallel pairs centered at 3; so 14 is blue. (15-16) Note that 21 is not green, since 4 is green but 5 and 10 are distinct colors. Now 15 is green; otherwise, a green/orange swap at 4,7 gives orange/purple crossing pairs centered at 1. Note that 18 is not red, since 1 is red but 9 and 15 are distinct colors. So 16 is red; otherwise a red/blue swap at 1,10 gives blue/purple crossing pairs centered at 11. (17) Suppose 17 is not red. If neither 19 nor 20 is purple, then a red/purple swap at 2,3,1,9 gives a red triple centered at 11. If neither 19 nor 20 is green, then a green/red swap at 2,4,1 gives a green triple centered at 3. So 19 and 20 are purple and green. Now we recolor 2 with orange and do a green/red swap at 4,1, which gives green/purple crossing pairs centered at 11. So 17 is red. (18-20) Now 18 is orange; otherwise an orange/purple swap at 9,11,3 gives an orange triple centered at 1. If neither 19 nor 20 is green, then a green/red swap at 2,4,1 gives a green triple centered at 3. If neither 19 nor 20 is orange, then we recolor 2 with orange and use a green/red swap at 4,1. This gives green/purple crossing pairs centered at 11. So 19 and 20 are green and orange. Now we recolor 9 with green. Afterwards, a red/purple swap at 1,3,2 gives a purple triple centered at 4. Case 3: 9 is blue. (10-11) Now 10 is orange, since all other colors are used on its neighborhood. If is orange, then we have orange/red parallel pairs centered at 3. So 11 is blue. (12-13) If 12 is green, then we are actually in Case 2, by reflecting horizontally and interchanging colors green and purple. So we assume that 12 is not green; thus, 12 is purple. Similarly, 17 is not green, by reflecting both vertically and horizontally, and interchanging both orange/blue and green/purple. Now 13 is green; otherwise a green/red swap at 1,4,2 gives a green triple centered at 3. 6 3 4 16 17 21 26 Figure 15: Case 3 in the proof of Lemma 15. (14) Note that 27 is not purple, since 3 is purple but and 9 have distinct colors. So, if 14 is not purple, then a purple/orange swap at 10,3 gives purple/orange parallel pairs, centered at 1. Thus, 14 is purple. (15-16) Now 15 and 16 must be orange and purple. If neither is orange, then recoloring 11 with orange gives orange/red parallel pairs centered at 3. If neither is purple, then a purple/blue swap at 11,3 gives blue/red crossing pairs centered at 4. So 15 and 16 are orange and purple. Suppose that 15 is purple. If 26 is blue, then we have blue/purple crossing pairs centered at 6. And if 26 is orange, then we have orange/purple parallel pairs centered at 6. So 26 is red. This means that 27 is blue. Now a green/orange swap at 6,10 gives green/red crossing pairs centered at 3. So we assume 15 is not purple. Thus, is orange and 16 is purple. (17-18) If 17 is purple, then we recolor 2 with orange, recolor 11 with red, and use a red/green swap at 151,4. This gives red/green parallel pairs centered at 3. Thus, 17 is orange. Now 23 is not green, since 4 is green but 5 and 17 have distinct colors. So 18 is green; otherwise, a green/blue swap at 8,4 gives green/blue parallel pairs centered at 2. (19-20) If neither 19 nor 20 is blue, then a blue/orange swap at 7 gives blue/red parallel pairs centered at 4. If neither 19 nor 20 is green, then a green/orange swap at 7,4 gives orange/red crossing pairs centered at 3. So 19 and 20 are blue and green. If 19 is green, then 23 is orange since 7 is orange. Thus, 25 is red; otherwise, we can recolor 5 red and get a red triple centered at 4. Now a blue/red swap at 8,2,11 gives red/green parallel pairs centered at 5. Thus, 19 is blue and 20 is green. (21-24) Note that 24 cannot be red, since 2 is red and 16 and 17 have distinct colors. So 21 is red; otherwise, a red/green swap at 13,2,4,1 gives a green triple centered at 3. Similarly, 22 is red; otherwise, a red/orange swap at 2,17 and a red/green swap at 1,4 gives a red triple centered at 8. Now 23 must be red; otherwise a red/blue swap at 8,2,11 gives 11 and 21 red but 16 and 17 with distinct colors, a contradiction. Finally, 24 is purple. If not, then we recolor 17 purple and repeat the argument above showing that 17 is orange, getting a contradiction. Now an orange/blue swap at 17,8 gives orange/red parallel pairs centered at 4. Case 4: 9 is green. (9-11) We assume that 10 is green; otherwise reflecting vertically (interchanging orange/blue) reduces to an earlier case. Further, either 11 or 24 is purple. Otherwise, a purple/red swap at 3 gives a purple triple centered at 4. By possibly reflecting vertically, we assume 11 is purple. 6 3 4 23 Figure 16: Case 4 in the proof of Lemma 15. (12) Note that 15 and 16 must each be either orange or blue, and they must have distinct colors; otherwise, we have parallel pairs centered at 3. Denote the colors of 15 and 16 by α and β, respectively. If neither 13 nor 17 is purple, then an α/purple swap at 15,3 gives α/red crossing pairs centered at 4. And if neither 13 nor 17 is β, then an α/β swap at 15 gives β/red parallel pairs centered at 3. So 13 and 17 are β and purple (in some order). By a similar argument, 18 and 14 are α and purple (in some order). Thus, 12 is red; otherwise, we recolor 6 red, which gives a red triple centered at 3. (13-14) If 17 is purple, then either 13 is orange and is blue or vice versa. In the first case, a blue/red swap at 15,1 gives red/purple crossing pairs centered at 6. In the second case, we recolor 1 blue, which gives blue/purple parallel pairs centered at 15. So 13 is purple. Suppose 18 is purple. If 15 is blue, then a red/blue swap at 15,1 gives red/purple parallel pairs centered at 6. If 15 is orange, then we recolor 1 blue and recolor 15 red. Again, we get red/purple parallel pairs centered at 6. So 14 is purple. (15-18) Suppose 15 is orange and 16 is blue. If 24 is purple, then recolor 1 blue, 2 orange, 15 red, and 16 red; this gives a red triple centered at 6. So 24 is orange. Recolor 1 blue. Use a red/purple swap at 2,3, and a red/orange swap at 3,15. This gives orange/purple parallel pairs centered at 16. So 15 is blue and is orange. This implies that 17 is orange and 18 is blue. (19-23) Note that 19 cannot be green, since 6 is green, but 12 and 13 have distinct colors. If 19 is purple, then a red/blue swap at 15,1 gives red/purple parallel pairs centered at 17. So 19 is blue. If 20 is red, then a red/blue swap at 1,15 gives a red triple centered at 17. So 20 is green. Note that 21 or 22 must be green; otherwise, a red/green swap at 12,6 gives a red triple centered at 3. And 22 cannot be green, since 6 is green but 12 and 14 have distinct colors. So 21 is green. If 22 is orange, then we recolor 12 purple and recolor 6 red, which gives a red triple centered at 3. So 22 is purple. Finally, 23 must be green; otherwise we have purple/red or purple/orange crossing pairs centered at 18. Now a blue/orange swap at 18,16 gives blue/orange parallel pairs centered at 6. Now we prove the main result of this section. Lemma 16. If G is a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 7, then every 5-coloring of G is 5-equivalent to a 5-coloring that contains a good 4-template. 16Proof. Let G be a graph satisfying the hypothesis, and let ϕ0 be a 5-coloring of G. By Lemma 14, ϕ0 is 5-equivalent to some 5-coloring ϕ1 that contains a pair. By Lemma 15, ϕ1 is 5-equivalent to some 5-coloring ϕ2 that contains either a triple, or parallel pairs, or crossing pairs. By Lemmas 10, 11, and 13. ϕ2 is 5-equivalent to some 5-coloring ϕ3 the contains a triple, and thus contains a good 4-template. 4 Extensions and Open Questions We begin the section by sketching the proof of Theorem 1. For reference, we repeat the statement below. Theorem 1. If G is a triangulated toroidal grid T [a × b] with a ≥ 6 and b ≥ 6, then all 5-colorings of G are 5-equivalent. Proof Sketch. We sketch how to modify the proof of the Main Theorem to prove Theorem 1. Recall that our Main Theorem handles the case that a ≥ 7 and b ≥ 7, since then G has edge-width at least 7. By symmetry, we can assume that a ≤ b. So assume that a = 6. By Lemma 7, we know G is 4-colorable; so Lemma 3 still applies. In fact, the only place that our proof uses edge-width 7 is when we apply Lemma to show that a subgraph H is locally connected. However, in the proof of Lemma 5 we only need the fact that H does not contain five vertices on a non-contractible cycle of length 6. The graph T [6 × 6] has exactly 18 non-contractible cycles of length 6. These run along the 6 rows, 6 columns, and 6 diagonals. And for T [6 × b] with b ≥ 7, we have b non-contractible cycles of length 6; each runs along a column. So, to adapt the proof to our present situation, it suffices to check that H does not contain exactly 5 vertices on any of these non-contractible 6-cycles. In the proofs of Lemmas 10 and 12, this is true. However, in the proofs of Lemmas 11 and 13, there is sometimes a single non-contractible cycle C of length 6 with 5 of its vertices in H. In this case, we simply add the final vertex v of C to T and to H, making v the sole vertex in its color in T . It is straightforward to check that the subgraph G − H − {v} is still connected. Thus, the proof of Lemma 5 still applies. In the introduction we mentioned that Mohar proved that if G is a planar graph with χ(G) = k, then all (k+ 1)-colorings of G are (k+ 1)-equivalent. Mohar also constructed, for any positive integers k, ℓ with k < ℓ a k-chromatic graph with a single k-coloring and with two ℓ-colorings that are not ℓ-equivalent (the graph is simply the categorical product of Kk and Kℓ; the details are in Proposition 2.1 of [13]). We would still like to find larger classes of graphs G for which all (χ(G) + 1)-colorings are (χ(G) + 1)-equivalent. Our conjectures below focus on graphs embedded in the torus, and other surfaces. We first state a lemma that will likely be useful in studying this problem. We call a template T in a graph G k-good if GT is k-degenerate. Lemma 17. Let G be a graph with χ(G) ≤ k. If ϕ1 and ϕ2 are (k + 1)-colorings of G that contain monochromatic k-good templates T1 and T2, respectively, then ϕ1 and ϕ2 are (k + 1)-equivalent. We omit the proof, since it is nearly identical to that of Lemma 3. Conjecture 1. If G is a triangulated toroidal grid T (a × b) (say with a ≥ 3 and b ≥ 3), then all 5-colorings of G are 5-equivalent. Conjecture 2. If G is a 4-chromatic toroidal graph, then all 5-colorings of G are 5-equivalent. Conjecture 3. If G is a toroidal graph, then all 5-colorings of G are 5-equivalent. Conjecture 4. For every surface S there exists cS such that if G embeds in S with edge-width at least cS, then all 5-colorings of G are 5-equivalent.

      "2. For a typical U, Lemmas III.3 and IV.1 together imply that X j> λ j = O |A| . (30) Thus, aside from λ1, the eigenvalues λj must be quite small. A typical eigenvalue distribution is plotted in Figure 1. If we define λ˜ j = λj/(1 − λ1), then P j>1 λ˜ j = 1 and H1(λ˜) ≥ H2(λ˜) = − lnX j> λ˜ j = 2 ln |A| − O(1). (31) An application of the grouping property then gives us a good lower bound on the von Neumann entropy: H (N ⊗ N¯ )(Φ)= H1(λ) = h(λ1) + (1 − λ1)H1(λ˜) = 2 ln |A| − O(1), (32) 0 100 200 300 400 500 10− 10− 10− 10− 10− Spectrum of the output density operator Eigenvalue index Eigenvalue FIG. 1: Typical eigenvalue spectrum of (N ⊗ N¯ )(Φ) when |R| = 3 and |A| = |B| = 24. The eigenvalues are plotted in increasing order from left to right. The green dashed line corresponds to |S|/(|A||B|) = 1/3, which is essentially equal to the largest eigenvalue. The red solid line represents the value (1− |S| |A||B| )/|A| 2 = 1/864. If the density operator were maximally mixed aside from its largest eigenvalue, all but that one eigenvalue would fall on this line. While that is not the case here or in general, the remaining eigenvalues are nonetheless sufficiently small to ensure that the density operator has high von Neumann entropy. where h is the binary entropy function. This entropy is nearly as large as it can be and, in particular, as large as Hmin(N ) + Hmin(N¯ ) according to Theorem IV.1 of [50], the von Neumann entropy version of Lemma III.2. V. DISCUSSION The counterexamples presented here demonstrate that the maximal p-norm multiplicativity conjecture and, equivalently, the minimum output p-R´enyi entropy conjecture are false for all 1 < p ≤ ∞. The primary motivation for studying this conjecture was that it is a natural strengthening of the minimum (von Neumann) output entropy conjecture, which is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory. In particular, since the multiplicativity conjecture was formulated, most attempts to prove the minimum output entropy conjecture for special cases actually proved maximal p-norm multiplicativity and then took the limit as p decreases to 1. This strategy, we now know, cannot be used to prove the conjecture in general. From that perspective, it would seem that the results in this paper cast doubt on the validity of the minimum output entropy conjecture itself. However, as we have shown, the examples explored here appear to be completely consistent with the conjecture, precisely because the von Neumann entropy is more difficult to perturb than the R´enyi entropies of order p > 1. It is therefore still possible that the p = 1 conjecture could be demonstrated using subtle variants of p-norm multiplicativity such as exact or approximate multiplicativity in a channel-dependent interval (1, 1 + δ). Another strategy that is still open would be to approach the von Neumann minimum output entropy via R´enyi entropies for p < 1. It is possible that additivity holds there even as it fails for p > 1. That is not, unfortunately, a very well-informed speculation. With few exceptions [57], there has been very little research on the additivity question in the regime p < 1, even though many arguments can be easily adapted to this parameter region. (Eq. (13), for example, holds for all 0 < p.) Unfortunately, since the time the examples presented here were first circulated, counterexamples for p close to 0 were also discovered [58], casting doubt on the conjecture for the whole set of R´enyi entropies with p < 1. Indeed, as in the current paper, those examples are based on influencing a single eigenvalue of the output state of the tensor product channel; while here we increase the largest one, there the smallest is suppressed. Thus, while it seems doubtful that the examples of channels presented here will have direct implications for the addivity of the minimum von Neumann entropy, we think that they are still very useful as a new class of test cases. Indeed, as we remarked earlier, our examples eliminate what had been the previously favoured route to the conjecture via the output p-norms. As a final comment, while this paper has demonstrated that the maximal p-norm additivity conjecture fails for p > 1, all the counterexamples presented here have been nonconstructive. For the examples based on ǫ-randomizing maps, all the known explicit constructions (by Ambainis and Smith [59] or via iterated quantum expander maps [60, 61]) only give bounds in the 2-norm, which do imply bounds on the output p-norm but those are too weak to yield counterexamples to multiplicativity. Likewise, the counterexamples based on generic quantum channels rely on the existence of large subspaces containing only highly entangled states. Even when the entanglement is quantified using von Neumann entropy, in which case the existence of these subspaces was demonstrated in 2003 [50], not a single explicit construction is known. The culprit, as in many other related contexts [62], is our use of the probabilistic method. Since we don't have any explicit counterexamples, only a proof that counterexamples exist, it remains an open problem to \"derandomize\" our argument.

We will estimate the integral, in what is perhaps not the most illuminating way, by expressing it in terms of the matrix entries of U. Let Us,ab = Rh0| S hs|U|ai A|biB. Expanding gives Z Tr h (N ⊗ N¯ )(|ΦihΦ|) i dU (A1) = |S| X a1,a a ′ ,a′ X b1,b b ′ ,b′ X s1,s s ′ ,s′ Z U¯ s1,a2b2U¯ s2,a′ b1U¯s ′ ,a′ b ′ U¯ s ′ ,a1b ′ Us1,a1b1Us2,a′ b2Us ′ ,a′ b ′ Us ′ ,a2b ′ dU. Following [63, 64], the non-zero terms in the sum can be represented using a simple graphical notation. Make two parallel columns of four dots, then label the left-hand dots by the indices (s1, s2, s′ , s′ ) and the right-hand dots by the indices ~v = (a2b2, a′ b1, a′ b ′ , a1b ′ ). Join dots with a solid line if the corresponding U¯ matrix entry appears in Eq. (A1). Since terms integrate to a nonzero value only if the vector of U indices ~w = (a1b1, a′ b2, a′ b ′ , a2b ′ ) is a permutation of the vector of U¯ indices, a non-zero integral can be represented by using a dotted line to connect left-hand and right-hand dots whenever the corresponding U matrix entry appears in the integral. Assuming for the moment that the vertex labels in the left column are all distinct and likewise for the right column, the integral evaluates to the Weingarten function Wg(π), where π is the permutation such that wi = vπ(i). For the rough estimate required here, it is sufficient to know that Wg(π) = Θ(|A||B|) −4−|π| , where |π| is the minimal number of factors required to write π as a product of transpositions, and that Wg(e) = (|A||B|) − 1 + O(|A| − |B| − ) [65]. The dominant contribution to Eq. (A1) comes from the \"stack\" diagram • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ , in which the solid and dashed lines are parallel and for which the contribution is positive and approximately equal to |S| X a1,a a ′ ,a′ X b1,b b ′ ,b′ X s1,s s ′ ,s′ δa1a2δb1b2δa ′ a ′ δb ′ b ′ 2 Wg(id) = |S| |A| 2|B| 1 + O(|A| − |B| − ) . (A2) (The expression on the left-hand side would be exact but for the terms in which vertex labels are not distinct.) To obtain an estimate of Eq. (A1), it is then sufficient to examine the other terms and confirm that they are all of smaller asymptotic order than this. There are six diagrams representing transpositions, and their associated (negative) contributions are • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a2b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b ′ N N N N p p p p Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a2b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b = = = = = Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a2b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a1b1, Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ p p p p N N N N Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a1b a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ = = = = = Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ) • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b a ′ b1 = a1b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ N N N N p p p p Θ(|S| |A| − |B| − ). For permutations π such that |π| > 1, the Weingarten function is significantly suppressed: Wg(π) = O(|A| − |B| − ). Moreover, for a given diagram type, the requirement that wi = vπ(i) can only hold if at least two pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. The contribution from such diagrams is therefore O(|S| |A| − |B| − ). To finish the proof, it is necessary to consider integrals in which the vertex labels on the left- or the right-hand side of a diagram are not all distinct. In this more general case, choosing a set C of representatives for the conjugacy classes of the permutation group on four elements, the value of the integral can be written X c∈C N(c)Wg(c), (A3) where N(c) = X σ∈S : ~v=σ(~v) X τ∈S : ~w=τ(~w) δ(τπσ ∈ c). (A4) These formulas have a simple interpretation. Symmetry in the vertex labels introduces ambiguities in the diagrammatic notation; the formula states that every one of the diagrams consistent with a given vertex label set must be counted, and with a defined dimension-independent multiplicity. Conveniently, our crude estimates have already done exactly that, ignoring the multiplicities. The only case for which we need to know the multiplicities, moreover, is for contributions to the dominant term, which we want to know exactly and not just up to a constant multiple. We claim that in the sum (A1) there are at most O(|S| |A||B| ) terms with vertex label symmetry. The total contribution for terms with vertex label symmetries τ and σ in which |τπσ| ≥ 1 is therefore of size O(|S| |A| − |B| − ) and does not affect the dominant term. To see why the claim holds, fix a diagram type and recall that the requirement wi = vπ(i)for a permutation π can only hold if at least two pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. Equality is achieved only when all the A indices or all the B indices are aligned, corresponding to the following two diagrams: • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b a ′ b1 = a1b a ′ b ′ 2 = a2b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b ′ N N N N p p p p N N N N p p p p • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a2b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b a1b ′ 1 = a1b N N N N p p p p For the first diagram, using the fact that |A| ≤ |B| ≤ |S|, it is easy to check that imposing the extra constraint that either the top or bottom two S or AB vertex labels match singles at most O(|S| |A||B| ) terms from Eq. (A1). Similar reasoning applies to the second diagram, but imposing the constraint instead on rows one and four, or two and three. For all other diagram types, at least four pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. (The number of matching A and B indices is necessarily even.) In a term for which the vertex labels are not all distinct, either a pair of S indices or a further pair of A or B indices must be identical. In the latter case, there must exist an identical A pair and an identical B pair among all the pairs. Again using |A| ≤ |B| ≤ |S|, there can be at most O(|S| |B| ) such terms per diagram type, which demonstrates the claim. We are thus left to consider integrals with vertex label symmetry and N(e) 6= 0 in Eq. (A3). If N(e) = 1, then our counting was correct and there is no problem. It is therefore sufficient to bound the number of integrals in which N(e) > 1. This can occur only in terms with at least 2 vertex label symmetries. Running the argument of the previous paragraph again, for the two diagrams with A or B indices all aligned, this occurs in at most O(|S| |B| ) terms. For the rest of the cases, it is necessary to impose equality on yet another pair of indices, leading again to at most O(|S| |B| ) terms. Since Wg(e) = O(|A| − |B| − ), these contributions are collectively O(|S| |A| − |B| − ). The bound on the error term in Eq. (29) arises by substituting the inequalities |S| ≤ |A||B| and |A| ≤ |B| into each of the estimates calculated above. [1] B. Schumacher. Quantum coding. Physical Review A, 51:2738–2747, 1995. [2] R.

      "2.1 An Introduction to Good Templates Given a coloring ϕ of G, our idea is to identify the vertices in one or more independent sets, each of which receives a common color under ϕ. If the resulting graph is 4-degenerate, then all of its 5-colorings are 5equivalent, as shown in Lemma 1; and these 5-colorings correspond to some of the 5-colorings of G (precisely those 5-colorings of G where the vertices in each identified independent set receive a common color). , k} is not used on the closed neighborhood 2For example, begin with the cartesian product of K3 and K2, drawn in the plane, and add a 4-vertex inside each 4-face. To simulate in G an α/β swap at a vertex v in GT , we simply perform an α/β swap at each vertex in G that was identified to form v. (If v ∈ V (G), then this is a single swap; but if v represents some non-singleton color of T , then this may be multiple swaps.) So most of the work in proving our Main Theorem (as well as Theorem 1) goes to showing that if G is a 6-regular toroidal graph with edge-width at least 7, then every 5-coloring of G is 5-equivalent to a coloring that contains a monochromatic good template. If H is a subgraph of G with diameter at most 4, then H is locally connected unless there exists a vertex w such that H contains at least four neighbors of w but excludes w. First, suppose instead that there exists a vertex w such that H contains at least four neighbors of w, but excludes w. By Pigeonhole, H contains some pair of non-adjacent vertices such that w is their only common neighbor. Since T ∪ {v} is a good template, every proper 5-coloring of T ∪ {v}, that respects its colors, extends to a 5-coloring of G (we simply color the vertices outside T ∪ {v} in the reverse of the 54-degeneracy order). Each circulant Cn[1, r, r + 1] has a natural embedding as a triangulation of the torus: begin with the hamiltonian cycle consisting of edges of \"length\" 1, wrapping around the torus in one direction, and now embed the remaining edges, each wrapping around the torus in the other direction. More specifically, if α(G) denotes the indpendence number of G, then simple arguments show that each of the graphs in parts (1–4) have α(G) < |G|/4, and thus, χ(G) ≥ |G|/α(G) > 4; details are given in Section 3 of [16]. Fix a positive integer g. If G is a 6-regular toroidal graph on n vertices chosen uniformly at random, then asymptotically almost surely the edge-width of G is at least g. Proof. Fix a positive integer n. We prove an upper bound on the fraction of 6-regular toroidal n-vertex graphs that have edge-width less than g, and we show that this fraction tend to 0 as n tends to infinity. More formally, to follow a straight line, the successor of each vertex v is 3 later than its predecessor in the cyclic order of neighbors of v. The factor 6 in Claim 1 arises from the 6 choices of neighbors to leave our initial vertex. We bound (independently of a and b) the number of integers c with 1 ≤ c ≤ a such that T [a × b, c] has edge-width less than g. We make no effort to optimize this bound, only to show that it is independent of a and b. If we consider the 6-regular triangulation of the plane, the set of automorphisms that fix a given vertex v has size 12; it has 6-fold rotational symmetry, together with reflection through a line containing v. The essential point is that our arguments do not make use of the global structure of G, but only of subgraphs of G of diameter at most 6. Along similar lines, it is possible that two vertices drawn as distinct in some figure are in fact the same vertex, when G has a short non-contractible cycle. However, the attentive reader will note that whenever we conclude that ϕ contains a good template T , the vertices of T are contained in some subgraph H with diameter at most 4. If 27, 29, and 30 do not have distinct colors, then some color β is absent from the closed neighborhood of 28, so we use an α/β swap at 28, ensuring that neither 28 nor 29 is α. Now some color is unused on the closed neighborhood of 30, so we can recolor 30, ensuring that it uses either α or β; this reduces to a case above. 5We must include 12 in the first template; otherwise, adding the bonus vertex w creates a subgraph that is not locally connected, since dG(11, w) = 2, but dH+w(11, w) > 2. Since we have no pair, these repeated colors appear \"across\" from each other; that is, each color appears on two vertices with 7 as their unique common neighbor. Now 13 and 14 are both green; for each vertex, three colors appear on its neighbors and a fourth is forbidden, since ϕ contains no pair. So, to adapt the proof to our present situation, it suffices to check that H does not contain exactly 5 vertices on any of these non-contractible 6-cycles. However, in the proofs of Lemmas 11 and 13, there is sometimes a single non-contractible cycle C of length 6 with 5 of its vertices in H. In this case, we simply add the final vertex v of C to T and to H, making v the sole vertex in its color in T . Mohar also constructed, for any positive integers k, ℓ with k < ℓ a k-chromatic graph with a single k-coloring and with two ℓ-colorings that are not ℓ-equivalent (the graph is simply the categorical product of Kk and Kℓ; the details are in Proposition 2.1 of [13]). Thanks to Bojan Mohar for helpful comments on the history of the classification of 6-regular toroidal graphs, as well as for bringing our attention to his construction that we mentioned in Section 4.\n",

      "(31) An application of the grouping property then gives us a good lower bound on the von Neumann entropy: H (N ⊗ N¯ )(Φ)= H1(λ) = h(λ1) + (1 − λ1)H1(λ˜) = 2 ln |A| − O(1), (32) 0 100 200 300 400 500 10− 10− 10− 10− 10− Spectrum of the output density operator Eigenvalue index Eigenvalue FIG. While that is not the case here or in general, the remaining eigenvalues are nonetheless sufficiently small to ensure that the density operator has high von Neumann entropy. The primary motivation for studying this conjecture was that it is a natural strengthening of the minimum (von Neumann) output entropy conjecture, which is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory. In particular, since the multiplicativity conjecture was formulated, most attempts to prove the minimum output entropy conjecture for special cases actually proved maximal p-norm multiplicativity and then took the limit as p decreases to 1. However, as we have shown, the examples explored here appear to be completely consistent with the conjecture, precisely because the von Neumann entropy is more difficult to perturb than the R´enyi entropies of order p > 1. It is therefore still possible that the p = 1 conjecture could be demonstrated using subtle variants of p-norm multiplicativity such as exact or approximate multiplicativity in a channel-dependent interval (1, 1 + δ). With few exceptions [57], there has been very little research on the additivity question in the regime p < 1, even though many arguments can be easily adapted to this parameter region. (13), for example, holds for all 0 < p.) Unfortunately, since the time the examples presented here were first circulated, counterexamples for p close to 0 were also discovered [58], casting doubt on the conjecture for the whole set of R´enyi entropies with p < 1. Indeed, as in the current paper, those examples are based on influencing a single eigenvalue of the output state of the tensor product channel; while here we increase the largest one, there the smallest is suppressed. Thus, while it seems doubtful that the examples of channels presented here will have direct implications for the addivity of the minimum von Neumann entropy, we think that they are still very useful as a new class of test cases. As a final comment, while this paper has demonstrated that the maximal p-norm additivity conjecture fails for p > 1, all the counterexamples presented here have been nonconstructive. For the examples based on ǫ-randomizing maps, all the known explicit constructions (by Ambainis and Smith [59] or via iterated quantum expander maps [60, 61]) only give bounds in the 2-norm, which do imply bounds on the output p-norm but those are too weak to yield counterexamples to multiplicativity. Even when the entanglement is quantified using von Neumann entropy, in which case the existence of these subspaces was demonstrated in 2003 [50], not a single explicit construction is known. Acknowledgments We would like to thank Fr´ed´eric Dupuis and Debbie Leung for an inspiring late-night conversation at the Perimeter Institute, Aram Harrow for several insightful suggestions, and Mary Beth Ruskai for discussions on the additivity conjecture. Since terms integrate to a nonzero value only if the vector of U indices ~w = (a1b1, a′ b2, a′ b ′ , a2b ′ ) is a permutation of the vector of U¯ indices, a non-zero integral can be represented by using a dotted line to connect left-hand and right-hand dots whenever the corresponding U matrix entry appears in the integral. Assuming for the moment that the vertex labels in the left column are all distinct and likewise for the right column, the integral evaluates to the Weingarten function Wg(π), where π is the permutation such that wi = vπ(i). For the rough estimate required here, it is sufficient to know that Wg(π) = Θ(|A||B|) −4−|π| , where |π| is the minimal number of factors required to write π as a product of transpositions, and that Wg(e) = (|A||B|) − 1 + O(|A| − |B| − ) [65]. (A1) comes from the \"stack\" diagram • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a1b a ′ b1 = a ′ b a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a2b ′ , in which the solid and dashed lines are parallel and for which the contribution is positive and approximately equal to |S| X a1,a a ′ ,a′ X b1,b b ′ ,b′ X s1,s s ′ ,s′ δa1a2δb1b2δa ′ a ′ δb ′ b ′ 2 Wg(id) = |S| |A| 2|B| 1 + O(|A| − |B| − ) . Moreover, for a given diagram type, the requirement that wi = vπ(i) can only hold if at least two pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. To finish the proof, it is necessary to consider integrals in which the vertex labels on the left- or the right-hand side of a diagram are not all distinct. In this more general case, choosing a set C of representatives for the conjugacy classes of the permutation group on four elements, the value of the integral can be written X c∈C N(c)Wg(c), (A3) where N(c) = X σ∈S : ~v=σ(~v) X τ∈S : ~w=τ(~w) δ(τπσ ∈ c). Symmetry in the vertex labels introduces ambiguities in the diagrammatic notation; the formula states that every one of the diagrams consistent with a given vertex label set must be counted, and with a defined dimension-independent multiplicity. To see why the claim holds, fix a diagram type and recall that the requirement wi = vπ(i)for a permutation π can only hold if at least two pairs of the indices a1, a2, a′ , a′ , b1, b2, b′ , b′ are identical. Equality is achieved only when all the A indices or all the B indices are aligned, corresponding to the following two diagrams: • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a ′ b a ′ b1 = a1b a ′ b ′ 2 = a2b ′ a1b ′ 1 = a ′ b ′ N N N N p p p p N N N N p p p p • • • • • • • s1 • s s ′ s ′ a2b2 = a2b ′ a ′ b1 = a ′ b ′ a ′ b ′ 2 = a ′ b a1b ′ 1 = a1b N N N N p p p p For the first diagram, using the fact that |A| ≤ |B| ≤ |S|, it is easy to check that imposing the extra constraint that either the top or bottom two S or AB vertex labels match singles at most O(|S| |A||B| ) terms from Eq.
